      "by their own account violence is for them a form of liberation in other words by committing violence they break through the psychological restraints that have been trained into them because they are oversocialized these restraints have been more confining for them than for others hence their need to break free of them but they usually justify their rebellion in terms of mainstream values if they engage in violence they claim to be fighting against racism or the like we realize that many objections could be raised to the foregoing thumb nail sketch of leftist psychology the real situation is complex and anything like a complete description of it would take several volumes even if the necessary data were available we claim only to have indicated very roughly the two most important tendencies in the psychology of modern leftism the problems of the leftist are indicative of the problems of our society as a whole low self esteem depressive tendencies and defeatism are not restricted to the left though they are especially noticeable in the left they are widespread in our society and today s society tries to socialize us to a greater extent than any previous society we are even told by experts how to eat how to exercise how to make love how to raise our kids and so forth the power process human beings have a need probably based in biology for something that we will call the power process this is closely related to the need for power which is widely recognized but is not quite the same thing the power process has four elements the three most clear cut of these we call goal effort and attainment of goal everyone needs to have goals whose attainment requires effort and needs to succeed in attaining at least some of his goals the fourth element is more difficult to define and may not be necessary for everyone we call it autonomy and will discuss it later paragraphs consider the hypothetical case of a man who can have anything he wants just by wishing for it such a man has power but he will develop serious psychological problems at first he will have a lot of fun but by and by he will become acutely bored and demoralized eventually he may become clinically depressed history shows that leisured aristocracies tend to become decadent this is not true of fighting aristocracies that have to struggle to maintain their power but leisured secure aristocracies that have no need to exert themselves usually become bored hedonistic and demoralized even though they have power this shows that power is not enough one must have goals toward which to exercise one s power everyone has goals if nothing else to obtain the physical necessities of life food water and whatever clothing and shelter are made necessary by the climate but the leisured aristocrat obtains these things without effort hence his boredom and demoralization nonattainment of important goals results in death if the goals are physical necessities and in frustration if nonattainment of the goals is compatible with survival consistent failure to attain goals throughout life results in defeatism low self esteem or depression thus in order to avoid serious psychological problems a human being needs goals whose attainment requires effort and he must have a reasonable rate of success in attaining his goals surrogate activities but not every leisured aristocrat becomes bored and demoralized for example the emperor hirohito instead of sinking into decadent hedonism devoted himself to marine biology a field in which he became distinguished when people do not have to exert themselves to satisfy their physical needs they often set up artificial goals for themselves in many cases they then pursue these goals with the same energy and emotional involvement that they otherwise would have put into the search for physical necessities thus the aristocrats of the roman empire had their literary pretentions many european aristocrats a few centuries ago invested tremendous time and energy in hunting though they certainly didn t need the meat other aristocracies have competed for status through elaborate displays of wealth and a few aristocrats like hirohito have turned to science we use the term surrogate activity to designate an activity that is directed toward an artificial goal that people set up for themselves merely in order to have some goal to work toward or let us say merely for the sake of the fulfillment that they get from pursuing the goal here is a rule of thumb for the identification of surrogate activities given a person who devotes much time and energy to the pursuit of goal x ask yourself this if he had to devote most of his time and energy to satisfying his biological needs and if that effort required him to use his physical and mental facilities in a varied and interesting way would he feel seriously deprived because he did not attain goal x if the answer is no then the person s pursuit of a goal x is a surrogate activity hirohito s studies in marine biology clearly constituted a surrogate activity since it is pretty certain that if hirohito had had to spend his time working at interesting non scientific tasks in order to obtain the necessities of life he would not have felt deprived because he didn t know all about the anatomy and life cycles of marine animals on the other hand the pursuit of sex and love for example is not a surrogate activity because most people even if their existence were otherwise satisfactory would feel deprived if they passed their lives without ever having a relationship with a member of the opposite sex but pursuit of an excessive amount of sex more than one really needs can be a surrogate activity in modern industrial society only minimal effort is necessary to satisfy one s physical needs it is enough to go through a training program to acquire some petty technical skill then come to work on time and exert very modest effort needed to hold a job the only requirements are a moderate amount of intelligence and most of all simple obedience if one has those society takes care of one from cradle to grave yes there is an underclass that cannot take physical necessities for granted but we are speaking here of mainstream society thus it is not surprising that modern society is full of surrogate activities these include scientific work athletic achievement humanitarian work artistic and literary creation climbing the corporate ladder acquisition of money and material goods far beyond the point at which they cease to give any additional physical satisfaction and social activism when it addresses issues that are not important for the activist personally as in the case of white activists who work for the rights of nonwhite minorities these are not always pure surrogate activities since for many people they may be motivated in part by needs other than the need to have some goal to pursue scientific work may be motivated in part by a drive for prestige artistic creation by a need to express feelings militant social activism by hostility but for most people who pursue them these activities are in large part surrogate activities for example the majority of scientists will probably agree that the fulfillment they get from their work is more important than the money and prestige they earn for many if not most people surrogate activities are less satisfying than the pursuit of real goals that is goals that people would want to attain even if their need for the power process were already fulfilled one indication of this is the fact that in many or most cases people who are deeply involved in surrogate activities are never satisfied never at rest thus the money maker constantly strives for more and more wealth the scientist no sooner solves one problem than he moves on to the next the long distance runner drives himself to run always farther and faster many people who pursue surrogate activities will say that they get far more fulfillment from these activities than they do from the mundane business of satisfying their biological needs but that it is because in our society the effort needed to satisfy the biological needs has been reduced to triviality more importantly in our society people do not satisfy their biological needs autonomously but by functioning as parts of an immense social machine in contrast people generally have a great deal of autonomy in pursuing their surrogate activities have a great deal of autonomy in pursuing their surrogate activities autonomy autonomy as a part of the power process may not be necessary for every individual but most people need a greater or lesser degree of autonomy in working toward their goals their efforts must be undertaken on their own initiative and must be under their own direction and control yet most people do not have to exert this initiative direction and control as single individuals it is usually enough to act as a member of a small group thus if half a dozen people discuss a goal among themselves and make a successful joint effort to attain that goal their need for the power process will be served but if they work under rigid orders handed down from above that leave them no room for autonomous decision and initiative then their need for the power process will not be served the same is true when decisions are made on a collective bases if the group making the collective decision is so large that the role of each individual is insignificant it is true that some individuals seem to have little need for autonomy either their drive for power is weak or they satisfy it by identifying themselves with some powerful organization to which they belong and then there are unthinking animal types who seem to be satisfied with a purely physical sense of power the good combat soldier who gets his sense of power by developing fighting skills that he is quite content to use in blind obedience to his superiors but for most people it is through the power process having a goal making an autonomous effort and attaining t the goal that self esteem self confidence and a sense of power are acquired when one does not have adequate opportunity to go throughout the power process the consequences are depending on the individual and on the way the power process is disrupted boredom demoralization low self esteem inferiority feelings defeatism depression anxiety guilt frustration hostility spouse or child abuse insatiable hedonism abnormal sexual behavior sleep disorders eating disorders etc sources of social problems any of the foregoing symptoms can occur in any society but in modern industrial society they are present on a massive scale we aren t the first to mention that the world today seems to be going crazy this sort of thing is not normal for human societies there is good reason to believe that primitive man suffered from less stress and frustration and was better satisfied with his way of life than modern man is it is true that not all was sweetness and light in primitive societies abuse of women and common among the australian aborigines transexuality was fairly common among some of the american indian tribes but is does appear that generally speaking the kinds of problems that we have listed in the preceding paragraph were far less common among primitive peoples than they are in modern society we attribute the social and psychological problems of modern society to the fact that that society requires people to live under conditions radically different from those under which the human race evolved and to behave in ways that conflict with the patterns of behavior that the human race developed while living under the earlier conditions it is clear from what we have already written that we consider lack of opportunity to properly experience the power process as the most important of the abnormal conditions to which modern society subjects people but it is not the only one before dealing with disruption of the power process as a source of social problems we will discuss some of the other sources among the abnormal conditions present in modern industrial society are excessive density of population isolation of man from nature excessive rapidity of social change and the break down of natural small scale communities such as the extended family the village or the tribe it is well known that crowding increases stress and aggression the degree of crowding that exists today and the isolation of man from nature are consequences of technological progress all pre industrial societies were predominantly rural the industrial revolution vastly increased the size of cities and the proportion of the population that lives in them and modern agricultural technology has made it possible for the earth to support a far denser population than it ever did before also technology exacerbates the effects of crowding because it puts increased disruptive powers in people s hands for example a variety of noise making devices power mowers radios motorcycles etc if the use of these devices is unrestricted people who want peace and quiet are frustrated by the noise if their use is restricted people who use the devices are frustrated by the regulations but if these machines had never been invented there would have been no conflict and no frustration generated by them for primitive societies the natural world which usually changes only slowly provided a stable framework and therefore a sense of security in the modern world it is human society that dominates nature rather than the other way around and modern society changes very rapidly owing to technological change thus there is no stable framework the conservatives are fools they whine about the decay of traditional values yet they enthusiastically support technological progress and economic growth apparently it never occurs to them that you can t make rapid drastic changes in the technology and the economy of a society with out causing rapid changes in all other aspects of the society as well and that such rapid changes inevitably break down traditional values the breakdown of traditional values to some extent implies the breakdown of the bonds that hold together traditional small scale social groups the disintegration of small scale social groups is also promoted by the fact that modern conditions often require or tempt individuals to move to new locations separating themselves from their communities beyond that a technological society has to weaken family ties and local communities if it is to function efficiently in modern society an individual s loyalty must be first to the system and only secondarily to a small scale community because if the internal loyalties of small scale small scale communities were stronger than loyalty to the system such communities would pursue their own advantage at the expense of the system suppose that a public official or a corporation executive appoints his cousin his friend or his co religionist to a position rather than appointing the person best qualified for the job he has permitted personal loyalty to supersede his loyalty to the system and that is nepotism or discrimination both of which are terrible sins in modern society would be industrial societies that have done a poor job of subordinating personal or local loyalties to loyalty to the system are usually very inefficient look at latin america thus an advanced industrial society can tolerate only those small scale communities that are emasculated tamed and made into tools of the system crowding rapid change and the breakdown of communities have been widely recognized as sources of social problems but we do not believe they are enough to account for the extent of the problems that are seen today a few pre industrial cities were very large and crowded yet their inhabitants do not seem to have suffered from psychological problems to the same extent as modern man in america today there still are uncrowded rural areas and we find there the same problems as in urban areas though the problems tend to be less acute in the rural areas thus crowding does not seem to be the decisive factor on the growing edge of the american frontier during the th century the mobility of the population probably broke down extended families and small scale social groups to at least the same extent as these are broken down today in fact many nuclear families lived by choice in such isolation having no neighbors within several miles that they belonged to no community at all yet they do not seem to have developed problems as a result furthermore change in american frontier society was very rapid and deep a man might be born and raised in a log cabin outside the reach of law and order and fed largely on wild meat and by the time he arrived at old age he might be working at a regular job and living in an ordered community with effective law enforcement this was a deeper change that that which typically occurs in the life of a modern individual yet it does not seem to have led to psychological problems in fact th century american society had an optimistic and self confident tone quite unlike that of today s society the difference we argue is that modern man has the sense largely justified that change is imposed on him whereas the th century frontiersman had the sense also largely justified that he created change himself by his own choice thus a pioneer settled on a piece of land of his own choosing and made it into a farm through his own effort in those days an entire county might have only a couple of hundred inhabitants and was a far more isolated and autonomous entity than a modern county is hence the pioneer farmer participated as a member of a relatively small group in the creation of a new ordered community one may well question whether the creation of this community was an improvement but at any rate it satisfied the pioneer s need for the power process it would be possible to give other examples of societies in which there has been rapid change and or lack of close community ties without he kind of massive behavioral aberration that is seen in today s industrial society we contend that the most important cause of social and psychological problems in modern society is the fact that people have insufficient opportunity to go through the power process in a normal way we don t mean to say that modern society is the only one in which the power process has been disrupted probably most if not all civilized societies have interfered with the power process to a greater or lesser extent but in modern industrial society the problem has become particularly acute leftism at least in its recent mid to late th century form is in part a symptom of deprivation with respect to the power process disruption of the power process in modern society we divide human drives into three groups those drives that can be satisfied with minimal effort those that can be satisfied but only at the cost of serious effort those that cannot be adequately satisfied no matter how much effort one makes the power process is the process of satisfying the drives of the second group the more drives there are in the third group the more there is frustration anger eventually defeatism depression etc in modern industrial society natural human drives tend to be pushed into the first and third groups and the second group tends to consist increasingly of artificially created drives in primitive societies physical necessities generally fall into group they can be obtained but only at the cost of serious effort but modern society tends to guaranty the physical necessities to everyone in exchange for only minimal effort hence physical needs are pushed into group there may be disagreement about whether the effort needed to hold a job is minimal but usually in lower to middle level jobs whatever effort is required is merely that of obedience you sit or stand where you are told to sit or stand and do what you are told to do in the way you are told to do it seldom do you have to exert yourself seriously and in any case you have hardly any autonomy in work so that the need for the power process is not well served social needs such as sex love and status often remain in group in modern society depending on the situation of the individual but except for people who have a particularly strong drive for status the effort required to fulfill the social drives is insufficient to satisfy adequately the need for the power process so certain artificial needs have been created that fall into group hence serve the need for the power process advertising and marketing techniques have been developed that make many people feel they need things that their grandparents never desired or even dreamed of it requires serious effort to earn enough money to satisfy these artificial needs hence they fall into group but see paragraphs modern man must satisfy his need for the power process largely through pursuit of the artificial needs created by the advertising and marketing industry and through surrogate activities it seems that for many people maybe the majority these artificial forms of the power process are insufficient a theme that appears repeatedly in the writings of the social critics of the second half of the th century is the sense of purposelessness that afflicts many people in modern society this purposelessness is often called by other names such as anomic or middle class vacuity we suggest that the so called identity crisis is actually a search for a sense of purpose often for commitment to a suitable surrogate activity it may be that existentialism is in large part a response to the purposelessness of modern life very widespread in modern society is the search for fulfillment but we think that for the majority of people an activity whose main goal is fulfillment that is a surrogate activity does not bring completely satisfactory fulfillment in other words it does not fully satisfy the need for the power process see paragraph that need can be fully satisfied only through activities that have some external goal such as physical necessities sex love status revenge etc moreover where goals are pursued through earning money climbing the status ladder or functioning as part of the system in some other way most people are not in a position to pursue their goals autonomously most workers are someone else s employee as as we pointed out in paragraph must spend their days doing what they are told to do in the way they are told to do it even most people who are in business for themselves have only limited autonomy it is a chronic complaint of small business persons and entrepreneurs that their hands are tied by excessive government regulation some of these regulations are doubtless unnecessary but for the most part government regulations are essential and inevitable parts of our extremely complex society a large portion of small business today operates on the franchise system it was reported in the wall street journal a few years ago that many of the franchise granting companies require applicants for franchises to take a personality test that is designed to exclude those who have creativity and initiative because such persons are not sufficiently docile to go along obediently with the franchise system this excludes from small business many of the people who most need autonomy today people live more by virtue of what the system does for them or to them than by virtue of what they do for themselves and what they do for themselves is done more and more along channels laid down by the system opportunities tend to be those that the system provides the opportunities must be exploited in accord with the rules and regulations and techniques prescribed by experts must be followed if there is to be a chance of success thus the power process is disrupted in our society through a deficiency of real goals and a deficiency of autonomy in pursuit of goals but it is also disrupted because of those human drives that fall into group the drives that one cannot adequately satisfy no matter how much effort one makes one of these drives is the need for security our lives depend on decisions made by other people we have no control over these decisions and usually we do not even know the people who make them we live in a world in which relatively few people maybe or make the important decisions philip b heymann of harvard law school quoted by anthony lewis new york times april our lives depend on whether safety standards at a nuclear power plant are properly maintained on how much pesticide is allowed to get into our food or how much pollution into our air on how skillful or incompetent our doctor is whether we lose or get a job may depend on decisions made by government economists or corporation executives and so forth most individuals are not in a position to secure themselves against these threats to more than a very limited extent the individual s search for security is therefore frustrated which leads to a sense of powerlessness it may be objected that primitive man is physically less secure than modern man as is shown by his shorter life expectancy hence modern man suffers from less not more than the amount of insecurity that is normal for human beings but psychological security does not closely correspond with physical security what makes us feel secure is not so much objective security as a sense of confidence in our ability to take care of ourselves primitive man threatened by a fierce animal or by hunger can fight in self defense or travel in search of food he has no certainty of success in these efforts but he is by no means helpless against the things that threaten him the modern individual on the other hand is threatened by many things against which he is helpless nuclear accidents carcinogens in food environmental pollution war increasing taxes invasion of his privacy by large organizations nation wide social or economic phenomena that may disrupt his way of life it is true that primitive man is powerless against some of the things that threaten him disease for example but he can accept the risk of disease stoically it is part of the nature of things it is no one s fault unless is the fault of some imaginary impersonal demon but threats to the modern individual tend to be man made they are not the results of chance but are imposed on him by other persons whose decisions he as an individual is unable to influence consequently he feels frustrated humiliated and angry thus primitive man for the most part has his security in his own hands either as an individual or as a member of a small group whereas the security of modern man is in the hands of persons or organizations that are too remote or too large for him to be able personally to influence them so modern man s drive for security tends to fall into groups and in some areas food shelter etc his security is assured at the cost of only trivial effort whereas in other areas he cannot attain security the foregoing greatly simplifies the real situation but it does indicate in a rough general way how the condition of modern man differs from that of primitive man people have many transitory drives or impulses that are necessary frustrated in modern life hence fall into group one may become angry but modern society cannot permit fighting in many situations it does not even permit verbal aggression when going somewhere one may be in a hurry or one may be in a mood to travel slowly but one generally has no choice but to move with the flow of traffic and obey the traffic signals one may want to do one s work in a different way but usually one can work only according to the rules laid down by one s employer in many other ways as well modern man is strapped down by a network of rules and regulations explicit or implicit that frustrate many of his impulses and thus interfere with the power process most of these regulations cannot be disposed with because the are necessary for the functioning of industrial society modern society is in certain respects extremely permissive in matters that are irrelevant to the functioning of the system we can generally do what we please we can believe in any religion we like as long as it does not encourage behavior that is dangerous to the system we can go to bed with anyone we like as long as we practice safe sex we can do anything we like as long as it is unimportant but in all important matters the system tends increasingly to regulate our behavior behavior is regulated not only through explicit rules and not only by the government control is often exercised through indirect coercion or through psychological pressure or manipulation and by organizations other than the government or by the system as a whole most large organizations use some form of propaganda to manipulate public attitudes or behavior propaganda is not limited to commercials and advertisements and sometimes it is not even consciously intended as propaganda by the people who make it for instance the content of entertainment programming is a powerful form of propaganda an example of indirect coercion there is no law that says we have to go to work every day and follow our employer s orders legally there is nothing to prevent us from going to live in the wild like primitive people or from going into business for ourselves but in practice there is very little wild country left and there is room in the economy for only a limited number of small business owners hence most of us can survive only as someone else s employee we suggest that modern man s obsession with longevity and with maintaining physical vigor and sexual attractiveness to an advanced age is a symptom of unfulfillment resulting from deprivation with respect to the power process the mid life crisis also is such a symptom so is the lack of interest in having children that is fairly common in modern society but almost unheard of in primitive societies in primitive societies life is a succession of stages the needs and purposes of one stage having been fulfilled there is no particular reluctance about passing on to the next stage a young man goes through the power process by becoming a hunter hunting not for sport or for fulfillment but to get meat that is necessary for food in young women the process is more complex with greater emphasis on social power we won t discuss that here this phase having been successfully passed through the young man has no reluctance about settling down to the responsibilities of raising a family in contrast some modern people indefinitely postpone having children because they are too busy seeking some kind of fulfillment we suggest that the fulfillment they need is adequate experience of the power process with real goals instead of the artificial goals of surrogate activities again having successfully raised his children going through the power process by providing them with the physical necessities the primitive man feels that his work is done and he is prepared to accept old age if he survives that long and death many modern people on the other hand are disturbed by the prospect of death as is shown by the amount of effort they expend trying to maintain their physical condition appearance and health we argue that this is due to unfulfillment resulting from the fact that they have never put their physical powers to any use have never gone through the power process using their bodies in a serious way it is not the primitive man who has used his body daily for practical purposes who fears the deterioration of age but the modern man who has never had a practical use for his body beyond walking from his car to his house it is the man whose need for the power process has been satisfied during his life who is best prepared to accept the end of that life in response to the arguments of this section someone will say society must find a way to give people the opportunity to go through the power process for such people the value of the opportunity is destroyed by the very fact that society gives it to them what they need is to find or make their own opportunities as long as the system gives them their opportunities it still has them on a leash to attain autonomy they must get off that leash how some people adjust not everyone in industrial technological society suffers from psychological problems some people even profess to be quite satisfied with society as it is we now discuss some of the reasons why people differ so greatly in their response to modern society first there doubtless are differences in the strength of the drive for power individuals with a weak drive for power may have relatively little need to go through the power process or at least relatively little need for autonomy in the power process these are docile types who would have been happy as plantation darkies in the old south we don t mean to sneer at plantation darkies of the old south to their credit most of the slaves were not content with their servitude we do sneer at people who are content with servitude some people may have some exceptional drive in pursuing which they satisfy their need for the power process for example those who have an unusually strong drive for social status may spend their whole lives climbing the status ladder without ever getting bored with that game people vary in their susceptibility to advertising and marketing techniques some people are so susceptible that even if they make a great deal of money they cannot satisfy their constant craving for the shiny new toys that the marketing industry dangles before their eyes so they always feel hard pressed financially even if their income is large and their cravings are frustrated some people have low susceptibility to advertising and marketing techniques these are the people who aren t interested in money material acquisition does not serve their need for the power process people who have medium susceptibility to advertising and marketing techniques are able to earn enough money to satisfy their craving for goods and services but only at the cost of serious effort putting in overtime taking a second job earning promotions etc thus material acquisition serves their need for the power process but it does not necessarily follow that their need is fully satisfied they may have insufficient autonomy in the power process their work may consist of following orders and some of their drives may be frustrated e g security aggression we are guilty of oversimplification in paragraphs because we have assumed that the desire for material acquisition is entirely a creation of the advertising and marketing industry of course it s not that simple some people partly satisfy their need for power by identifying themselves with a powerful organization or mass movement an individual lacking goals or power joins a movement or an organization adopts its goals as his own then works toward these goals when some of the goals are attained the individual even though his personal efforts have played only an insignificant part in the attainment of the goals feels through his identification with the movement or organization as if he had gone through the power process this phenomenon was exploited by the fascists nazis and communists our society uses it too though less crudely example manuel noriega was an irritant to the u s goal punish noriega the u s invaded panama effort and punished noriega attainment of goal the u s went through the power process and many americans because of their identification with the u s experienced the power process vicariously hence the widespread public approval of the panama invasion it gave people a sense of power we see the same phenomenon in armies corporations political parties humanitarian organizations religious or ideological movements in particular leftist movements tend to attract people who are seeking to satisfy their need for power but for most people identification with a large organization or a mass movement does not fully satisfy the need for power another way in which people satisfy their need for the power process is through surrogate activities as we explained in paragraphs a surrogate activity that is directed toward an artificial goal that the individual pursues for the sake of the fulfillment that he gets from pursuing the goal not because he needs to attain the goal itself for instance there is no practical motive for building enormous muscles hitting a little ball into a hole or acquiring a complete series of postage stamps yet many people in our society devote themselves with passion to bodybuilding golf or stamp collecting some people are more other directed than others and therefore will more readily attack importance to a surrogate activity simply because the people around them treat it as important or because society tells them it is important that is why some people get very serious about essentially trivial activities such as sports or bridge or chess or arcane scholarly pursuits whereas others who are more clear sighted never see these things as anything but the surrogate activities that they are and consequently never attach enough importance to them to satisfy their need for the power process in that way it only remains to point out that in many cases a person s way of earning a living is also a surrogate activity not a pure surrogate activity since part of the motive for the activity is to gain the physical necessities and for some people social status and the luxuries that advertising makes them want but many people put into their work far more effort than is necessary to earn whatever money and status they require and this extra effort constitutes a surrogate activity this extra effort together with the emotional investment that accompanies it is one of the most potent forces acting toward the continual development and perfecting of the system with negative consequences for individual freedom see paragraph especially for the most creative scientists and engineers work tends to be largely a surrogate activity this point is so important that is deserves a separate discussion which we shall give in a moment paragraphs in this section we have explained how many people in modern society do satisfy their need for the power process to a greater or lesser extent but we think that for the majority of people the need for the power process is not fully satisfied in the first place those who have an insatiable drive for status or who get firmly hooked or a surrogate activity or who identify strongly enough with a movement or organization to satisfy their need for power in that way are exceptional personalities others are not fully satisfied with surrogate activities or by identification with an organization see paragraphs in the second place too much control is imposed by the system through explicit regulation or through socialization which results in a deficiency of autonomy and in frustration due to the impossibility of attaining certain goals and the necessity of restraining too many impulses but even if most people in industrial technological society were well satisfied we fc would still be opposed to that form of society because among other reasons we consider it demeaning to fulfill one s need for the power process through surrogate activities or through identification with an organization rather then through pursuit of real goals the motives of scientists science and technology provide the most important examples of surrogate activities some scientists claim that they are motivated by curiosity that notion is simply absurd most scientists work on highly specialized problem that are not the object of any normal curiosity for example is an astronomer a mathematician or an entomologist curious about the properties of isopropyltrimethylmethane of course not only a chemist is curious about such a thing and he is curious about it only because chemistry is his surrogate activity is the chemist curious about the appropriate classification of a new species of beetle no that question is of interest only to the entomologist and he is interested in it only because entomology is his surrogate activity if the chemist and the entomologist had to exert themselves seriously to obtain the physical necessities and if that effort exercised their abilities in an interesting way but in some nonscientific pursuit then they couldn t giver a damn about isopropyltrimethylmethane or the classification of beetles suppose that lack of funds for postgraduate education had led the chemist to become an insurance broker instead of a chemist in that case he would have been very interested in insurance matters but would have cared nothing about isopropyltrimethylmethane in any case it is not normal to put into the satisfaction of mere curiosity the amount of time and effort that scientists put into their work the curiosity explanation for the scientists motive just doesn t stand up the benefit of humanity explanation doesn t work any better some scientific work has no conceivable relation to the welfare of the human race most of archaeology or comparative linguistics for example some other areas of science present obviously dangerous possibilities yet scientists in these areas are just as enthusiastic about their work as those who develop vaccines or study air pollution consider the case of dr edward teller who had an obvious emotional involvement in promoting nuclear power plants did this involvement stem from a desire to benefit humanity if so then why didn t dr teller get emotional about other humanitarian causes if he was such a humanitarian then why did he help to develop the h bomb as with many other scientific achievements it is very much open to question whether nuclear power plants actually do benefit humanity does the cheap electricity outweigh the accumulating waste and risk of accidents dr teller saw only one side of the question clearly his emotional involvement with nuclear power arose not from a desire to benefit humanity but from a personal fulfillment he got from his work and from seeing it put to practical use the same is true of scientists generally with possible rare exceptions their motive is neither curiosity nor a desire to benefit humanity but the need to go through the power process to have a goal a scientific problem to solve to make an effort research and to attain the goal solution of the problem science is a surrogate activity because scientists work mainly for the fulfillment they get out of the work itself of course it s not that simple other motives do play a role for many scientists money and status for example some scientists may be persons of the type who have an insatiable drive for status see paragraph and this may provide much of the motivation for their work no doubt the majority of scientists like the majority of the general population are more or less susceptible to advertising and marketing techniques and need money to satisfy their craving for goods and services thus science is not a pure surrogate activity but it is in large part a surrogate activity also science and technology constitute a mass power movement and many scientists gratify their need for power through identification with this mass movement see paragraph thus science marches on blindly without regard to the real welfare of the human race or to any other standard obedient only to the psychological needs of the scientists and of the government officials and corporation executives who provide the funds for research the nature of freedom we are going to argue that industrial technological society cannot be reformed in such a way as to prevent it from progressively narrowing the sphere of human freedom but because freedom is a word that can be interpreted in many ways we must first make clear what kind of freedom we are concerned with by freedom we mean the opportunity to go through the power process with real goals not the artificial goals of surrogate activities and without interference manipulation or supervision from anyone especially from any large organization freedom means being in control either as an individual or as a member of a small group of the life and death issues of one s existence food clothing shelter and defense against whatever threats there may be in one s environment freedom means having power not the power to control other people but the power to control the circumstances of one s own life one does not have freedom if anyone else especially a large organization has power over one no matter how benevolently tolerantly and permissively that power may be exercised it is important not to confuse freedom with mere permissiveness see paragraph it is said that we live in a free society because we have a certain number of constitutionally guaranteed rights but these are not as important as they seem the degree of personal freedom that exists in a society is determined more by the economic and technological structure of the society than by its laws or its form of government most of the indian nations of new england were monarchies and many of the cities of the italian renaissance were controlled by dictators but in reading about these societies one gets the impression that they allowed far more personal freedom than out society does in part this was because they lacked efficient mechanisms for enforcing the ruler s will there were no modern well organized police forces no rapid long distance communications no surveillance cameras no dossiers of information about the lives of average citizens hence it was relatively easy to evade control as for our constitutional rights consider for example that of freedom of the press we certainly don t mean to knock that right it is very important tool for limiting concentration of political power and for keeping those who do have political power in line by publicly exposing any misbehavior on their part but freedom of the press is of very little use to the average citizen as an individual the mass media are mostly under the control of large organizations that are integrated into the system anyone who has a little money can have something printed or can distribute it on the internet or in some such way but what he has to say will be swamped by the vast volume of material put out by the media hence it will have no practical effect to make an impression on society with words is therefore almost impossible for most individuals and small groups take us fc for example if we had never done anything violent and had submitted the present writings to a publisher they probably would not have been accepted if they had been accepted and published they probably would not have attracted many readers because it s more fun to watch the entertainment put out by the media than to read a sober essay even if these writings had had many readers most of these readers would soon have forgotten what they had read as their minds were flooded by the mass of material to which the media expose them in order to get our message before the public with some chance of making a lasting impression we ve had to kill people constitutional rights are useful up to a point but they do not serve to guarantee much more than what could be called the bourgeois conception of freedom according to the bourgeois conception a free man is essentially an element of a social machine and has only a certain set of prescribed and delimited freedoms freedoms that are designed to serve the needs of the social machine more than those of the individual thus the bourgeois s free man has economic freedom because that promotes growth and progress he has freedom of the press because public criticism restrains misbehavior by political leaders he has a rights to a fair trial because imprisonment at the whim of the powerful would be bad for the system this was clearly the attitude of simon bolivar to him people deserved liberty only if they used it to promote progress progress as conceived by the bourgeois other bourgeois thinkers have taken a similar view of freedom as a mere means to collective ends chester c tan chinese political thought in the twentieth century page explains the philosophy of the kuomintang leader hu han min an individual is granted rights because he is a member of society and his community life requires such rights by community hu meant the whole society of the nation and on page tan states that according to carsum chang chang chun mai head of the state socialist party in china freedom had to be used in the interest of the state and of the people as a whole but what kind of freedom does one have if one can use it only as someone else prescribes fc s conception of freedom is not that of bolivar hu chang or other bourgeois theorists the trouble with such theorists is that they have made the development and application of social theories their surrogate activity consequently the theories are designed to serve the needs of the theorists more than the needs of any people who may be unlucky enough to live in a society on which the theories are imposed one more point to be made in this section it should not be assumed that a person has enough freedom just because he says he has enough freedom is restricted in part by psychological control of which people are unconscious and moreover many people s ideas of what constitutes freedom are governed more by social convention than by their real needs for example it s likely that many leftists of the oversocialized type would say that most people including themselves are socialized too little rather than too much yet the oversocialized leftist pays a heavy psychological price for his high level of socialization some principles of history think of history as being the sum of two components an erratic component that consists of unpredictable events that follow no discernible pattern and a regular component that consists of long term historical trends here we are concerned with the long term trends first principle if a small change is made that affects a long term historical trend then the effect of that change will almost always be transitory the trend will soon revert to its original state example a reform movement designed to clean up political corruption in a society rarely has more than a short term effect sooner or later the reformers relax and corruption creeps back in the level of political corruption in a given society tends to remain constant or to change only slowly with the evolution of the society normally a political cleanup will be permanent only if accompanied by widespread social changes a small change in the society won t be enough if a small change in a long term historical trend appears to be permanent it is only because the change acts in the direction in which the trend is already moving so that the trend is not altered but only pushed a step ahead the first principle is almost a tautology if a trend were not stable with respect to small changes it would wander at random rather than following a definite direction in other words it would not be a long term trend at all second principle if a change is made that is sufficiently large to alter permanently a long term historical trend than it will alter the society as a whole in other words a society is a system in which all parts are interrelated and you can t permanently change any important part without change all the other parts as well third principle if a change is made that is large enough to alter permanently a long term trend then the consequences for the society as a whole cannot be predicted in advance unless various other societies have passed through the same change and have all experienced the same consequences in which case one can predict on empirical grounds that another society that passes through the same change will be like to experience similar consequences fourth principle a new kind of society cannot be designed on paper that is you cannot plan out a new form of society in advance then set it up and expect it to function as it was designed to the third and fourth principles result from the complexity of human societies a change in human behavior will affect the economy of a society and its physical environment the economy will affect the environment and vice versa and the changes in the economy and the environment will affect human behavior in complex unpredictable ways and so forth the network of causes and effects is far too complex to be untangled and understood fifth principle people do not consciously and rationally choose the form of their society societies develop through processes of social evolution that are not under rational human control the fifth principle is a consequence of the other four to illustrate by the first principle generally speaking an attempt at social reform either acts in the direction in which the society is developing anyway so that it merely accelerates a change that would have occurred in any case or else it only has a transitory effect so that the society soon slips back into its old groove to make a lasting change in the direction of development of any important aspect of a society reform is insufficient and revolution is required a revolution does not necessarily involve an armed uprising or the overthrow of a government by the second principle a revolution never changes only one aspect of a society and by the third principle changes occur that were never expected or desired by the revolutionaries by the fourth principle when revolutionaries or utopians set up a new kind of society it never works out as planned the american revolution does not provide a counterexample the american revolution was not a revolution in our sense of the word but a war of independence followed by a rather far reaching political reform the founding fathers did not change the direction of development of american society nor did they aspire to do so they only freed the development of american society from the retarding effect of british rule their political reform did not change any basic trend but only pushed american political culture along its natural direction of development british society of which american society was an off shoot had been moving for a long time in the direction of representative democracy and prior to the war of independence the americans were already practicing a significant degree of representative democracy in the colonial assemblies the political system established by the constitution was modeled on the british system and on the colonial assemblies with major alteration to be sure there is no doubt that the founding fathers took a very important step but it was a step along the road the english speaking world was already traveling the proof is that britain and all of its colonies that were populated predominantly by people of british descent ended up with systems of representative democracy essentially similar to that of the united states if the founding fathers had lost their nerve and declined to sign the declaration of independence our way of life today would not have been significantly different maybe we would have had somewhat closer ties to britain and would have had a parliament and prime minister instead of a congress and president no big deal thus the american revolution provides not a counterexample to our principles but a good illustration of them still one has to use common sense in applying the principles they are expressed in imprecise language that allows latitude for interpretation and exceptions to them can be found so we present these principles not as inviolable laws but as rules of thumb or guides to thinking that may provide a partial antidote to naive ideas about the future of society the principles should be borne constantly in mind and whenever one reaches a conclusion that conflicts with them one should carefully reexamine one s thinking and retain the conclusion only if one has good solid reasons for doing so industrial technological society cannot be reformed the foregoing principles help to show how hopelessly difficult it would be to reform the industrial system in such a way as to prevent it from progressively narrowing our sphere of freedom there has been a consistent tendency going back at least to the industrial revolution for technology to strengthen the system at a high cost in individual freedom and local autonomy hence any change designed to protect freedom from technology would be contrary to a fundamental trend in the development of our society consequently such a change either would be a transitory one soon swamped by the tide of history or if large enough to be permanent would alter the nature of our whole society this by the first and second principles moreover since society would be altered in a way that could not be predicted in advance third principle there would be great risk changes large enough to make a lasting difference in favor of freedom would not be initiated because it would realized that they would gravely disrupt the system so any attempts at reform would be too timid to be effective even if changes large enough to make a lasting difference were initiated they would be retracted when their disruptive effects became apparent thus permanent changes in favor of freedom could be brought about only by persons prepared to accept radical dangerous and unpredictable alteration of the entire system in other words by revolutionaries not reformers people anxious to rescue freedom without sacrificing the supposed benefits of technology will suggest naive schemes for some new form of society that would reconcile freedom with technology apart from the fact that people who make suggestions seldom propose any practical means by which the new form of society could be set up in the first place it follows from the fourth principle that even if the new form of society could be once established it either would collapse or would give results very different from those expected so even on very general grounds it seems highly improbably that any way of changing society could be found that would reconcile freedom with modern technology in the next few sections we will give more specific reasons for concluding that freedom and technological progress are incompatible restriction of freedom is unavoidable in industrial society as explained in paragraph modern man is strapped down by a network of rules and regulations and his fate depends on the actions of persons remote from him whose decisions he cannot influence this is not accidental or a result of the arbitrariness of arrogant bureaucrats it is necessary and inevitable in any technologically advanced society the system has to regulate human behavior closely in order to function at work people have to do what they are told to do otherwise production would be thrown into chaos bureaucracies have to be run according to rigid rules to allow any substantial personal discretion to lower level bureaucrats would disrupt the system and lead to charges of unfairness due to differences in the way individual bureaucrats exercised their discretion it is true that some restrictions on our freedom could be eliminated but generally speaking the regulation of our lives by large organizations is necessary for the functioning of industrial technological society the result is a sense of powerlessness on the part of the average person it may be however that formal regulations will tend increasingly to be replaced by psychological tools that make us want to do what the system requires of us propaganda educational techniques mental health programs etc the system has to force people to behave in ways that are increasingly remote from the natural pattern of human behavior for example the system needs scientists mathematicians and engineers it can t function without them so heavy pressure is put on children to excel in these fields it isn t natural for an adolescent human being to spend the bulk of his time sitting at a desk absorbed in study a normal adolescent wants to spend his time in active contact with the real world among primitive peoples the things that children are trained to do are in natural harmony with natural human impulses among the american indians for example boys were trained in active outdoor pursuits just the sort of things that boys like but in our society children are pushed into studying technical subjects which most do grudgingly in any technologically advanced society the individual s fate must depend on decisions that he personally cannot influence to any great extent a technological society cannot be broken down into small autonomous communities because production depends on the cooperation of very large numbers of people when a decision affects say a million people then each of the affected individuals has on the average only a one millionth share in making the decision what usually happens in practice is that decisions are made by public officials or corporation executives or by technical specialists but even when the public votes on a decision the number of voters ordinarily is too large for the vote of any one individual to be significant thus most individuals are unable to influence measurably the major decisions that affect their lives their is no conceivable way to remedy this in a technologically advanced society the system tries to solve this problem by using propaganda to make people want the decisions that have been made for them but even if this solution were completely successful in making people feel better it would be demeaning conservatives and some others advocate more local autonomy local communities once did have autonomy but such autonomy becomes less and less possible as local communities become more enmeshed with and dependent on large scale systems like public utilities computer networks highway systems the mass communications media the modern health care system also operating against autonomy is the fact that technology applied in one location often affects people at other locations far away thus pesticide or chemical use near a creek may contaminate the water supply hundreds of miles downstream and the greenhouse effect affects the whole world the system does not and cannot exist to satisfy human needs instead it is human behavior that has to be modified to fit the needs of the system this has nothing to do with the political or social ideology that may pretend to guide the technological system it is the fault of technology because the system is guided not by ideology but by technical necessity of course the system does satisfy many human needs but generally speaking it does this only to the extent that it is to the advantage of the system to do it it is the needs of the system that are paramount not those of the human being for example the system provides people with food because the system couldn t function if everyone starved it attends to people s psychological needs whenever it can conveniently do so because it couldn t function if too many people became depressed or rebellious but the system for good solid practical reasons must exert constant pressure on people to mold their behavior to the needs of the system too much waste accumulating the government the media the educational system environmentalists everyone inundates us with a mass of propaganda about recycling need more technical personnel a chorus of voices exhorts kids to study science no one stops to ask whether it is inhumane to force adolescents to spend the bulk of their time studying subjects most of them hate when skilled workers are put out of a job by technical advances and have to undergo retraining no one asks whether it is humiliating for them to be pushed around in this way it is simply taken for granted that everyone must bow to technical necessity and for good reason if human needs were put before technical necessity there would be economic problems unemployment shortages or worse the concept of mental health in our society is defined largely by the extent to which an individual behaves in accord with the needs of the system and does so without showing signs of stress efforts to make room for a sense of purpose and for autonomy within the system are no better than a joke for example one company instead of having each of its employees assemble only one section of a catalogue had each assemble a whole catalogue and this was supposed to give them a sense of purpose and achievement some companies have tried to give their employees more autonomy in their work but for practical reasons this usually can be done only to a very limited extent and in any case employees are never given autonomy as to ultimate goals their autonomous efforts can never be directed toward goals that they select personally but only toward their employer s goals such as the survival and growth of the company any company would soon go out of business if it permitted its employees to act otherwise similarly in any enterprise within a socialist system workers must direct their efforts toward the goals of the enterprise otherwise the enterprise will not serve its purpose as part of the system once again for purely technical reasons it is not possible for most individuals or small groups to have much autonomy in industrial society even the small business owner commonly has only limited autonomy apart from the necessity of government regulation he is restricted by the fact that he must fit into the economic system and conform to its requirements for instance when someone develops a new technology the small business person often has to use that technology whether he wants to or not in order to remain competitive the bad parts of technology cannot be separated from the good parts a further reason why industrial society cannot be reformed in favor of freedom is that modern technology is a unified system in which all parts are dependent on one another you can t get rid of the bad parts of technology and retain only the good parts take modern medicine for example progress in medical science depends on progress in chemistry physics biology computer science and other fields advanced medical treatments require expensive high tech equipment that can be made available only by a technologically progressive economically rich society clearly you can t have much progress in medicine without the whole technological system and everything that goes with it even if medical progress could be maintained without the rest of the technological system it would by itself bring certain evils suppose for example that a cure for diabetes is discovered people with a genetic tendency to diabetes will then be able to survive and reproduce as well as anyone else natural selection against genes for diabetes will cease and such genes will spread throughout the population this may be occurring to some extent already since diabetes while not curable can be controlled through the use of insulin the same thing will happen with many other diseases susceptibility to which is affected by genetic degradation of the population the only solution will be some sort of eugenics program or extensive genetic engineering of human beings so that man in the future will no longer be a creation of nature or of chance or of god depending on your religious or philosophical opinions but a manufactured product if you think that big government interferes in your life too much now just wait till the government starts regulating the genetic constitution of your children such regulation will inevitably follow the introduction of genetic engineering of human beings because the consequences of unregulated genetic engineering would be disastrous the usual response to such concerns is to talk about medical ethics but a code of ethics would not serve to protect freedom in the face of medical progress it would only make matters worse a code of ethics applicable to genetic engineering would be in effect a means of regulating the genetic constitution of human beings somebody probably the upper middle class mostly would decide that such and such applications of genetic engineering were ethical and others were not so that in effect they would be imposing their own values on the genetic constitution of the population at large even if a code of ethics were chosen on a completely democratic basis the majority would be imposing their own values on any minorities who might have a different idea of what constituted an ethical use of genetic engineering the only code of ethics that would truly protect freedom would be one that prohibited any genetic engineering of human beings and you can be sure that no such code will ever be applied in a technological society no code that reduced genetic engineering to a minor role could stand up for long because the temptation presented by the immense power of biotechnology would be irresistible especially since to the majority of people many of its applications will seem obviously and unequivocally good eliminating physical and mental diseases giving people the abilities they need to get along in today s world inevitably genetic engineering will be used extensively but only in ways consistent with the needs of the industrial technological system technology is a more powerful social force than the aspiration for freedom it is not possible to make a lasting compromise between technology and freedom because technology is by far the more powerful social force and continually encroaches on freedom through repeated compromises imagine the case of two neighbors each of whom at the outset owns the same amount of land but one of whom is more powerful than the other the powerful one demands a piece of the other s land the weak one refuses the powerful one says ok let s compromise give me half of what i asked the weak one has little choice but to give in some time later the powerful neighbor demands another piece of land again there is a compromise and so forth by forcing a long series of compromises on the weaker man the powerful one eventually gets all of his land so it goes in the conflict between technology and freedom let us explain why technology is a more powerful social force than the aspiration for freedom a technological advance that appears not to threaten freedom often turns out to threaten freedom often turns out to threaten it very seriously later on for example consider motorized transport a walking man formerly could go where he pleased go at his own pace without observing any traffic regulations and was independent of technological support systems when motor vehicles were introduced they appeared to increase man s freedom they took no freedom away from the walking man no one had to have an automobile if he didn t want one and anyone who did choose to buy an automobile could travel much faster than the walking man but the introduction of motorized transport soon changed society in such a way as to restrict greatly man s freedom of locomotion when automobiles became numerous it became necessary to regulate their use extensively in a car especially in densely populated areas one cannot just go where one likes at one s own pace one s movement is governed by the flow of traffic and by various traffic laws one is tied down by various obligations license requirements driver test renewing registration insurance maintenance required for safety monthly payments on purchase price moreover the use of motorized transport is no longer optional since the introduction of motorized transport the arrangement of our cities has changed in such a way that the majority of people no longer live within walking distance of their place of employment shopping areas and recreational opportunities so that they have to depend on the automobile for transportation or else they must use public transportation in which case they have even less control over their own movement than when driving a car even the walker s freedom is now greatly restricted in the city he continually has to stop and wait for traffic lights that are designed mainly to serve auto traffic in the country motor traffic makes it dangerous and unpleasant to walk along the highway note the important point we have illustrated with the case of motorized transport when a new item of technology is introduced as an option that an individual can accept or not as he chooses it does not necessarily remain optional in many cases the new technology changes society in such a way that people eventually find themselves forced to use it while technological progress as a whole continually narrows our sphere of freedom each new technical advance considered by itself appears to be desirable electricity indoor plumbing rapid long distance communications how could one argue against any of these things or against any other of the innumerable technical advances that have made modern society it would have been absurd to resist the introduction of the telephone for example it offered many advantages and no disadvantages yet as we explained in paragraphs all these technical advances taken together have created world in which the average man s fate is no longer in his own hands or in the hands of his neighbors and friends but in those of politicians corporation executives and remote anonymous technicians and bureaucrats whom he as an individual has no power to influence the same process will continue in the future take genetic engineering for example few people will resist the introduction of a genetic technique that eliminates a hereditary disease it does no apparent harm and prevents much suffering yet a large number of genetic improvements taken together will make the human being into an engineered product rather than a free creation of chance or of god or whatever depending on your religious beliefs another reason why technology is such a powerful social force is that within the context of a given society technological progress marches in only one direction it can never be reversed once a technical innovation has been introduced people usually become dependent on it unless it is replaced by some still more advanced innovation not only do people become dependent as individuals on a new item of technology but even more the system as a whole becomes dependent on it imagine what would happen to the system today if computers for example were eliminated thus the system can move in only one direction toward greater technologization technology repeatedly forces freedom to take a step back short of the overthrow of the whole technological system technology advances with great rapidity and threatens freedom at many different points at the same time crowding rules and regulations increasing dependence of individuals on large organizations propaganda and other psychological techniques genetic engineering invasion of privacy through surveillance devices and computers etc to hold back any one of the threats to freedom would require a long different social struggle those who want to protect freedom are overwhelmed by the sheer number of new attacks and the rapidity with which they develop hence they become pathetic and no longer resist to fight each of the threats separately would be futile success can be hoped for only by fighting the technological system as a whole but that is revolution not reform technicians we use this term in its broad sense to describe all those who perform a specialized task that requires training tend to be so involved in their work their surrogate activity that when a conflict arises between their technical work and freedom they almost always decide in favor of their technical work this is obvious in the case of scientists but it also appears elsewhere educators humanitarian groups conservation organizations do not hesitate to use propaganda or other psychological techniques to help them achieve their laudable ends corporations and government agencies when they find it useful do not hesitate to collect information about individuals without regard to their privacy law enforcement agencies are frequently inconvenienced by the constitutional rights of suspects and often of completely innocent persons and they do whatever they can do legally or sometimes illegally to restrict or circumvent those rights most of these educators government officials and law officers believe in freedom privacy and constitutional rights but when these conflict with their work they usually feel that their work is more important it is well known that people generally work better and more persistently when striving for a reward than when attempting to avoid a punishment or negative outcome scientists and other technicians are motivated mainly by the rewards they get through their work but those who oppose technilogiccal invasions of freedom are working to avoid a negative outcome consequently there are a few who work persistently and well at this discouraging task if reformers ever achieved a signal victory that seemed to set up a solid barrier against further erosion of freedom through technological progress most would tend to relax and turn their attention to more agreeable pursuits but the scientists would remain busy in their laboratories and technology as it progresses would find ways in spite of any barriers to exert more and more control over individuals and make them always more dependent on the system no social arrangements whether laws institutions customs or ethical codes can provide permanent protection against technology history shows that all social arrangements are transitory they all change or break down eventually but technological advances are permanent within the context of a given civilization suppose for example that it were possible to arrive at some social arrangements that would prevent genetic engineering from being applied to human beings or prevent it from being applied in such a ways as to threaten freedom and dignity still the technology would remain waiting sooner or later the social arrangement would break down probably sooner given that pace of change in our society then genetic engineering would begin to invade our sphere of freedom and this invasion would be irreversible short of a breakdown of technological civilization itself any illusions about achieving anything permanent through social arrangements should be dispelled by what is currently happening with environmental legislation a few years ago it seemed that there were secure legal barriers preventing at least some of the worst forms of environmental degradation a change in the political wind and those barriers begin to crumble for all of the foregoing reasons technology is a more powerful social force than the aspiration for freedom but this statement requires an important qualification it appears that during the next several decades the industrial technological system will be undergoing severe stresses due to economic and environmental problems and especially due to problems of human behavior alienation rebellion hostility a variety of social and psychological difficulties we hope that the stresses through which the system is likely to pass will cause it to break down or at least weaken it sufficiently so that a revolution occurs and is successful then at that particular moment the aspiration for freedom will have proved more powerful than technology in paragraph we used an analogy of a weak neighbor who is left destitute by a strong neighbor who takes all his land by forcing on him a series of compromises but suppose now that the strong neighbor gets sick so that he is unable to defend himself the weak neighbor can force the strong one to give him his land back or he can kill him if he lets the strong man survive and only forces him to give his land back he is a fool because when the strong man gets well he will again take all the land for himself the only sensible alternative for the weaker man is to kill the strong one while he has the chance in the same way while the industrial system is sick we must destroy it if we compromise with it and let it recover from its sickness it will eventually wipe out all of our freedom simpler social problems have proved intractable if anyone still imagines that it would be possible to reform the system in such a way as to protect freedom from technology let him consider how clumsily and for the most part unsuccessfully our society has dealt with other social problems that are far more simple and straightforward among other things the system has failed to stop environmental degradation political corruption drug trafficking or domestic abuse take our environmental problems for example here the conflict of values is straightforward economic expedience now versus saving some of our natural resources for our grandchildren but on this subject we get only a lot of blather and obfuscation from the people who have power and nothing like a clear consistent line of action and we keep on piling up environmental problems that our grandchildren will have to live with attempts to resolve the environmental issue consist of struggles and compromises between different factions some of which are ascendant at one moment others at another moment the line of struggle changes with the shifting currents of public opinion this is not a rational process or is it one that is likely to lead to a timely and successful solution to the problem major social problems if they get solved at all are rarely or never solved through any rational comprehensive plan they just work themselves out through a process in which various competing groups pursing their own usually short term self interest arrive mainly by luck at some more or less stable modus vivendi in fact the principles we formulated in paragraphs make it seem doubtful that rational long term social planning can ever be successful thus it is clear that the human race has at best a very limited capacity for solving even relatively straightforward social problems how then is it going to solve the far more difficult and subtle problem of reconciling freedom with technology technology presents clear cut material advantages whereas freedom is an abstraction that means different things to different people and its loss is easily obscured by propaganda and fancy talk and note this important difference it is conceivable that our environmental problems for example may some day be settled through a rational comprehensive plan but if this happens it will be only because it is in the long term interest of the system to solve these problems but it is not in the interest of the system to preserve freedom or small group autonomy on the contrary it is in the interest of the system to bring human behavior under control to the greatest possible extent thus while practical considerations may eventually force the system to take a rational prudent approach to environmental problems equally practical considerations will force the system to regulate human behavior ever more closely preferably by indirect means that will disguise the encroachment on freedom this isn t just our opinion eminent social scientists e g james q wilson have stressed the importance of socializing people more effectively revolution is easier than reform we hope we have convinced the reader that the system cannot be reformed in a such a way as to reconcile freedom with technology the only way out is to dispense with the industrial technological system altogether this implies revolution not necessarily an armed uprising but certainly a radical and fundamental change in the nature of society people tend to assume that because a revolution involves a much greater change than reform does it is more difficult to bring about than reform is actually under certain circumstances revolution is much easier than reform the reason is that a revolutionary movement can inspire an intensity of commitment that a reform movement cannot inspire a reform movement merely offers to solve a particular social problem a revolutionary movement offers to solve all problems at one stroke and create a whole new world it provides the kind of ideal for which people will take great risks and make great sacrifices for this reasons it would be much easier to overthrow the whole technological system than to put effective permanent restraints on the development of application of any one segment of technology such as genetic engineering but under suitable conditions large numbers of people may devote themselves passionately to a revolution against the industrial technological system as we noted in paragraph reformers seeking to limite certain aspects of technology would be working to avoid a negative outcome but revolutionaries work to gain a powerful reward fulfillment of their revolutionary vision and therefore work harder and more persistently than reformers do reform is always restrainde by the fear of painful consequences if changes go too far but once a revolutionary fever has taken hold of a society people are willing to undergo unlimited hardships for the sake of their revolution this was clearly shown in the french and russian revolutions it may be that in such cases only a minority of the population is really committed to the revolution but this minority is sufficiently large and active so that it becomes the dominant force in society we will have more to say about revolution in paragraphs control of human behavior since the beginning of civilization organized societies have had to put pressures on human beings of the sake of the functioning of the social organism the kinds of pressures vary greatly from one society to another some of the pressures are physical poor diet excessive labor environmental pollution some are psychological noise crowding forcing humans behavior into the mold that society requires in the past human nature has been approximately constant or at any rate has varied only within certain bounds consequently societies have been able to push people only up to certain limits when the limit of human endurance has been passed things start going rong rebellion or crime or corruption or evasion of work or depression and other mental problems or an elevated death rate or a declining birth rate or something else so that either the society breaks down or its functioning becomes too inefficient and it is quickly or gradually through conquest attrition or evolution replaces by some more efficient form of society thus human nature has in the past put certain limits on the development of societies people coud be pushed only so far and no farther but today this may be changing because modern technology is developing way of modifying human beings imagine a society that subjects people to conditions that amke them terribley unhappy then gives them the drugs to take away their unhappiness science fiction it is already happening to some extent in our own society it is well known that the rate of clinical depression had been greatly increasing in recent decades we believe that this is due to disruption fo the power process as explained in paragraphs but even if we are wrong the increasing rate of depression is certainly the result of some conditions that exist in today s society instead of removing the conditions that make people depressed modern society gives them antidepressant drugs in effect antidepressants area a means of modifying an individual s internal state in such a way as to enable him to toelrate social conditions that he would otherwise find intolerable yes we know that depression is often of purely genetic origin we are referring here to those cases in which environment plays the predominant role drugs that affect the mind are only one example of the methods of controlling human behavior that modern society is developing let us look at some of the other methods to start with there are the techniques of surveillance hidden video cameras are now used in most stores and in many other places computers are used to collect and process vast amounts of information about individuals information so obtained greatly increases the effectiveness of physical coercion i e law enforcement then there are the methods of propaganda for which the mass communication media provide effective vehicles efficient techniques have been developed for winning elections selling products influencing public opinion the entertainment industry serves as an important psychological tool of the system possibly even when it is dishing out large amounts of sex and violence entertainment provides modern man with an essential means of escape while absorbed in television videos etc he can forget stress anxiety frustration dissatisfaction many primitive peoples when they don t have work to do are quite content to sit for hours at a time doing nothing at all because they are at peace with themselves and their world but most modern people must be contantly occupied or entertained otherwise the get bored i e they get fidgety uneasy irritable other techniques strike deeper that the foregoing education is no longer a simple affair of paddling a kid s behind when he doesn t know his lessons and patting him on the head when he does know them it is becoming a scientific technique for controlling the child s development sylvan learning centers for example have had great success in motivating children to study and psychological techniques are also used with more or less success in many conventional schools parenting techniques that are taught to parents are designed to make children accept fundamental values of the system and behave in ways that the system finds desirable mental health programs intervention techniques psychotherapy and so forth are ostensibly designed to benefit individuals but in practice they usually serve as methods for inducing individuals to think and behave as the system requires there is no contradiction here an individual whose attitudes or behavior bring him into conflict with the system is up against a force that is too powerful for him to conquer or escape from hence he is likely to suffer from stress frustration defeat his path will be much easier if he thinks and behaves as the system requires in that sense the system is acting for the benefit of the individual when it brainwashes him into conformity child abuse in its gross and obvious forms is disapproved in most if not all cultures tormenting a child for a trivial reason or no reason at all is something that appalls almost everyone but many psychologists interpret the concept of abuse much more broadly is spanking when used as part of a rational and consistent system of discipline a form of abuse the question will ultimately be decided by whether or not spanking tends to produce behavior that makes a person fit in well with the existing system of society in practice the word abuse tends to be interpreted to include any method of child rearing that produces behavior inconvenient for the system thus when they go beyond the prevention of obvious senseless cruelty programs for preventing child abuse are directed toward the control of human behavior of the system presumably research will continue to increas the effectiveness of psychological techniques for controlling human behavior but we think it is unlikely that psychological techniques alone will be sufficient to adjust human beings to the kind of society that technology is creating biological methods probably will have to be used we have already mentiond the use of drugs in this connection neurology may provide other avenues of modifying the human mind genetic engineering of human beings is already beginning to occur in the form of gene therapy and there is no reason to assume the such methods will not eventually be used to modify those aspects of the body that affect mental funtioning as we mentioned in paragraph industrial society seems likely to be entering a period of severe stress due in part to problems of human behavior and in part to economic and environmental problems and a considerable proportion of the system s economic and environmental problems result from the way human beings behave alienation low self esteem depression hostility rebellion children who won t study youth gangs illegal drug use rape child abuse other crimes unsafe sex teen pregnancy population growth political corruption race hatred ethnic rivalry bitter ideological conflict i e pro choice vs pro life political extremism terrorism sabotage anti government groups hate groups all these threaten the very survival of the system the system will be forced to use every practical means of controlling human behavior the social disruption that we see today is certainly not the result of mere chance it can only be a result fo the conditions of life that the system imposes on people we have argued that the most important of these conditions is disruption of the power process if the systems succeeds in imposing sufficient control over human behavior to assure itw own survival a new watershed in human history will have passed whereas formerly the limits of human endurance have imposed limits on the development of societies as we explained in paragraphs industrial technological society will be able to pass those limits by modifying human beings whether by psychological methods or biological methods or both in the future social systems will not be adjusted to suit the needs of human beings instead human being will be adjusted to suit the needs of the system generally speaking technological control over human behavior will probably not be introduced with a totalitarian intention or even through a conscious desire to restrict human freedom each new step in the assertion of control over the human mind will be taken as a rational response to a problem that faces society such as curing alcoholism reducing the crime rate or inducing young people to study science and engineering in many cases there will be humanitarian justification for example when a psychiatrist prescribes an anti depressant for a depressed patient he is clearly doing that individual a favor it would be inhumane to withhold the drug from someone who needs it when parents send their children to sylvan learning centers to have them manipulated into becoming enthusiastic about their studies they do so from concern for their children s welfare it may be that some of these parents wish that one didn t have to have specialized training to get a job and that their kid didn t have to be brainwashed into becoming a computer nerd but what can they do they can t change society and their child may be unemployable if he doesn t have certain skills so they send him to sylvan thus control over human behavior will be introduced not by a calculated decision of the authorities but through a process of social evolution rapid evolution however the process will be impossible to resist because each advance considered by itself will appear to be beneficial or at least the evil involved in making the advance will appear to be beneficial or at least the evil involved in making the advance will seem to be less than that which would result from not making it see paragraph propaganda for example is used for many good purposes such as discouraging child abuse or race hatred sex education is obviously useful yet the effect of sex education to the extent that it is successful is to take the shaping of sexual attitudes away from the family and put it into the hands of the state as represented by the public school system suppose a biological trait is discovered that increases the likelihood that a child will grow up to be a criminal and suppose some sort of gene therapy can remove this trait of course most parents whose children possess the trait will have them undergo the therapy it would be inhumane to do otherwise since the child would probably have a miserable life if he grew up to be a criminal but many or most primitive societies have a low crime rate in comparison with that of our society even though they have neither high tech methods of child rearing nor harsh systems of punishment since there is no reason to suppose that more modern men than primitive men have innate predatory tendencies the high crime rate of our society must be due to the pressures that modern conditions put on people to which many cannot or will not adjust thus a treatment designed to remove potential criminal tendencies is at least in part a way of re engineering people so that they suit the requirements of the system our society tends to regard as a sickness any mode of thought or behavior that is inconvenient for the system and this is plausible because when an individual doesn t fit into the system it causes pain to the individual as well as problems for the system thus the manipulation of an individual to adjust him to the system is seen as a cure for a sickness and therefore as good in paragraph we pointed out that if the use of a new item of technology is initially optional it does not necessarily remain optional because the new technology tends to change society in such a way that it becomes difficult or impossible for an individual to function without using that technology this applies also to the technology of human behavior in a world in which most children are put through a program to make them enthusiastic about studying a parent will almost be forced to put his kid through such a program because if he does not then the kid will grow up to be comparatively speaking an ignoramus and therefore unemployable or suppose a biological treatment is discovered that without undesirable side effects will greatly reduce the psychological stress from which so many people suffer in our society if large numbers of people choose to undergo the treatment then the general level of stress in society will be reduced so that it will be possible for the system to increase the stress producing pressures in fact something like this seems to have happened already with one of our society s most important psychological tools for enabling people to reduce or at least temporarily escape from stress namely mass entertainment see paragraph our use of mass entertainment is optional no law requires us to watch television listen to the radio read magazines yet mass entertainment is a means of escape and stress reduction on which most of us have become dependent everyone complains about the trashiness of television but almost everyone watches it a few have kicked the tv habit but it would be a rare person who could get along today without using any form of mass entertainment yet until quite recently in human history most people got along very nicely with no other entertainment than that which each local community created for itself without the entertainment industry the system probably would not have been able to get away with putting as much stress producing pressure on us as it does assuming that industrial society survives it is likely that technology will eventually acquire something approaching complete control over human behavior it has been established beyond any rational doubt that human thought and behavior have a largely biological basis as experimenters have demonstrated feelings such as hunger pleasure anger and fear can be turned on and off by electrical stimulation of appropriate parts of the brain memories can be destroyed by damaging parts of the brain or they can be brought to the surface by electrical stimulation hallucinations can be induced or moods changed by drugs there may or may not be an immaterial human soul but if there is one it clearly is less powerful that the biological mechanisms of human behavior for if that were not the case then researchers would not be able so easily to manipulate human feelings and behavior with drugs and electrical currents it presumably would be impractical for all people to have electrodes inserted in their heads so that they could be controlled by the authorities but the fact that human thoughts and feelings are so open to biological intervention shows that the problem of controlling human behavior is mainly a technical problem a problem of neurons hormones and complex molecules the kind of problem that is accessible to scientific attack given the outstanding record of our society in solving technical problems it is overwhelmingly probable that great advances will be made in the control of human behavior will public resistance prevent the introduction of technological control of human behavior it certainly would if an attempt were made to introduce such control all at once but since technological control will be introduced through a long sequence of small advances there will be no rational and effective public resistance see paragraphs to those who think that all this sounds like science fiction we point out that yesterday s science fiction is today s fact the industrial revolution has radically altered man s environment and way of life and it is only to be expected that as technology is increasingly applied to the human body and mind man himself will be altered as radically as his environment and way of life have been human race at a crossroads but we have gotten ahead of our story it is one thing to develop in the laboratory a series of psychological or biological techniques for manipulating human behavior and quite another to integrate these techniques into a functioning social system the latter problem is the more difficult of the two for example while the techniques of educational psychology doubtless work quite well in the lab schools where they are developed it is not necessarily easy to apply them effectively throughout our educational system we all know what many of our schools are like the teachers are too busy taking knives and guns away from the kids to subject them to the latest techniques for making them into computer nerds thus in spite of all its technical advances relating to human behavior the system to date has not been impressively successful in controlling human beings the people whose behavior is fairly well under the control of the system are those of the type that might be called bourgeois but there are growing numbers of people who in one way or another are rebels against the system welfare leaches youth gangs cultists satanists nazis radical environmentalists militiamen etc the system is currently engaged in a desperate struggle to overcome certain problems that threaten its survival among which the problems of human behavior are the most important if the system succeeds in acquiring sufficient control over human behavior quickly enough it will probably survive otherwise it will break down we think the issue will most likely be resolved within the next several decades say to years suppose the system survives the crisis of the next several decades by that time it will have to have solved or at least brought under control the principal problems that confront it in particular that of socializing human beings that is making people sufficiently docile so that their behavior no longer threatens the system that being accomplished it does not appear that there would be any further obstacle to the development of technology and it would presumably advance toward its logical conclusion which is complete control over everything on earth including human beings and all other important organisms the system may become a unitary monolithic organization or it may be more or less fragmented and consist of a number of organizations coexisting in a relationship that includes elements of both cooperation and competition just as today the government the corporations and other large organizations both cooperate and compete with one another human freedom mostly will have vanished because individuals and small groups will be impotent vis a vis large organizations armed with supertechnology and an arsenal of advanced psychological and biological tools for manipulating human beings besides instruments of surveillance and physical coercion only a small number of people will have any real power and even these probably will have only very limited freedom because their behavior too will be regulated just as today our politicians and corporation executives can retain their positions of power only as long as their behavior remains within certain fairly narrow limits don t imagine that the systems will stop developing further techniques for controlling human beings and nature once the crisis of the next few decades is over and increasing control is no longer necessary for the system s survival on the contrary once the hard times are over the system will increase its control over people and nature more rapidly because it will no longer be hampered by difficulties of the kind that it is currently experiencing survival is not the principal motive for extending control as we explained in paragraphs technicians and scientists carry on their work largely as a surrogate activity that is they satisfy their need for power by solving technical problems they will continue to do this with unabated enthusiasm and among the most interesting and challenging problems for them to solve will be those of understanding the human body and mind and intervening in their development for the good of humanity of course but suppose on the other hand that the stresses of the coming decades prove to be too much for the system if the system breaks down there may be a period of chaos a time of troubles such as those that history has recorded at various epochs in the past it is impossible to predict what would emerge from such a time of troubles but at any rate the human race would be given a new chance the greatest danger is that industrial society may begin to reconstitute itself within the first few years after the breakdown certainly there will be many people power hungry types especially who will be anxious to get the factories running again therefore two tasks confront those who hate the servitude to which the industrial system is reducing the human race first we must work to heighten the social stresses within the system so as to increase the likelihood that it will break down or be weakened sufficiently so that a revolution against it becomes possible second it is necessary to develop and propagate an ideology that opposes technology and the industrial society if and when the system becomes sufficiently weakened and such an ideology will help to assure that if and when industrial society breaks down its remnants will be smashed beyond repair so that the system cannot be reconstituted the factories should be destroyed technical books burned etc human suffering the industrial system will not break down purely as a result of revolutionary action it will not be vulnerable to revolutionary attack unless its own internal problems of development lead it into very serious difficulties so if the system breaks down it will do so either spontaneously or through a process that is in part spontaneous but helped along by revolutionaries if the breakdown is sudden many people will die since the world s population has become so overblown that it cannot even feed itself any longer without advanced technology even if the breakdown is gradual enough so that reduction of the population can occur more through lowering of the birth rate than through elevation of the death rate the process of de industrialization probably will be very chaotic and involve much suffering it is naive to think it likely that technology can be phased out in a smoothly managed orderly way especially since the technophiles will fight stubbornly at every step is it therefore cruel to work for the breakdown of the system maybe but maybe not in the first place revolutionaries will not be able to break the system down unless it is already in deep trouble so that there would be a good chance of its eventually breaking down by itself anyway and the bigger the system grows the more disastrous the consequences of its breakdown will be so it may be that revolutionaries by hastening the onset of the breakdown will be reducing the extent of the disaster in the second place one has to balance the struggle and death against the loss of freedom and dignity to many of us freedom and dignity are more important than a long life or avoidance of physical pain besides we all have to die some time and it may be better to die fighting for survival or for a cause than to live a long but empty and purposeless life in the third place it is not all certain that the survival of the system will lead to less suffering than the breakdown of the system would the system has already caused and is continuing to cause immense suffering all over the world ancient cultures that for hundreds of years gave people a satisfactory relationship with each other and their environment have been shattered by contact with industrial society and the result has been a whole catalogue of economic environmental social and psychological problems one of the effects of the intrusion of industrial society has been that over much of the world traditional controls on population have been thrown out of balance hence the population explosion with all that it implies then there is the psychological suffering that is widespread throughout the supposedly fortunate countries of the west see paragraphs no one knows what will happen as a result of ozone depletion the greenhouse effect and other environmental problems that cannot yet be foreseen and as nuclear proliferation has shown new technology cannot be kept out of the hands of dictators and irresponsible third world nations would you like to speculate abut what iraq or north korea will do with genetic engineering oh say the technophiles science is going to fix all that we will conquer famine eliminate psychological suffering make everybody healthy and happy yeah sure that s what they said years ago the industrial revolution was supposed to eliminate poverty make everybody happy etc the actual result has been quite different the technophiles are hopelessly naive or self deceiving in their understanding of social problems they are unaware of or choose to ignore the fact that when large changes even seemingly beneficial ones are introduced into a society they lead to a long sequence of other changes most of which are impossible to predict paragraph the result is disruption of the society so it is very probable that in their attempt to end poverty and disease engineer docile happy personalities and so forth the technophiles will create social systems that are terribly troubled even more so that the present one for example the scientists boast that they will end famine by creating new genetically engineered food plants but this will allow the human population to keep expanding indefinitely and it is well known that crowding leads to increased stress and aggression this is merely one example of the predictable problems that will arise we emphasize that as past experience has shown technical progress will lead to other new problems for society far more rapidly that it has been solving old ones thus it will take a long difficult period of trial and error for the technophiles to work the bugs out of their brave new world if they ever do in the meantime there will be great suffering so it is not all clear that the survival of industrial society would involve less suffering than the breakdown of that society would technology has gotten the human race into a fix from which there is not likely to be any easy escape the future but suppose now that industrial society does survive the next several decade and that the bugs do eventually get worked out of the system so that it functions smoothly what kind of system will it be we will consider several possibilities first let us postulate that the computer scientists succeed in developing intelligent machines that can do all things better that human beings can do them in that case presumably all work will be done by vast highly organized systems of machines and no human effort will be necessary either of two cases might occur the machines might be permitted to make all of their own decisions without human oversight or else human control over the machines might be retained if the machines are permitted to make all their own decisions we can t make any conjectures as to the results because it is impossible to guess how such machines might behave we only point out that the fate of the human race would be at the mercy of the machines it might be argued that the human race would never be foolish enough to hand over all the power to the machines but we are suggesting neither that the human race would voluntarily turn power over to the machines nor that the machines would willfully seize power what we do suggest is that the human race might easily permit itself to drift into a position of such dependence on the machines that it would have no practical choice but to accept all of the machines decisions as society and the problems that face it become more and more complex and machines become more and more intelligent people will let machines make more of their decision for them simply because machine made decisions will bring better result than man made ones eventually a stage may be reached at which the decisions necessary to keep the system running will be so complex that human beings will be incapable of making them intelligently at that stage the machines will be in effective control people won t be able to just turn the machines off because they will be so dependent on them that turning them off would amount to suicide on the other hand it is possible that human control over the machines may be retained in that case the average man may have control over certain private machines of his own such as his car of his personal computer but control over large systems of machines will be in the hands of a tiny elite just as it is today but with two difference due to improved techniques the elite will have greater control over the masses and because human work will no longer be necessary the masses will be superfluous a useless burden on the system if the elite is ruthless the may simply decide to exterminate the mass of humanity if they are humane they may use propaganda or other psychological or biological techniques to reduce the birth rate until the mass of humanity becomes extinct leaving the world to the elite or if the elite consist of soft hearted liberals they may decide to play the role of good shepherds to the rest of the human race they will see to it that everyone s physical needs are satisfied that all children are raised under psychologically hygienic conditions that everyone has a wholesome hobby to keep him busy and that anyone who may become dissatisfied undergoes treatment to cure his problem of course life will be so purposeless that people will have to be biologically or psychologically engineered either to remove their need for the power process or to make them sublimate their drive for power into some harmless hobby these engineered human beings may be happy in such a society but they most certainly will not be free they will have been reduced to the status of domestic animals but suppose now that the computer scientists do not succeed in developing artificial intelligence so that human work remains necessary even so machines will take care of more and more of the simpler tasks so that there will be an increasing surplus of human workers at the lower levels of ability we see this happening already there are many people who find it difficult or impossible to get work because for intellectual or psychological reasons they cannot acquire the level of training necessary to make themselves useful in the present system on those who are employed ever increasing demands will be placed they will need more and m ore training more and more ability and will have to be ever more reliable conforming and docile because they will be more and more like cells of a giant organism their tasks will be increasingly specialized so that their work will be in a sense out of touch with the real world being concentrated on one tiny slice of reality the system will have to use any means that i can whether psychological or biological to engineer people to be docile to have the abilities that the system requires and to sublimate their drive for power into some specialized task but the statement that the people of such a society will have to be docile may require qualification the society may find competitiveness useful provided that ways are found of directing competitiveness into channels that serve that needs of the system we can imagine into channels that serve the needs of the system we can imagine a future society in which there is endless competition for positions of prestige an power but no more than a very few people will ever reach the top where the only real power is see end of paragraph very repellent is a society in which a person can satisfy his needs for power only by pushing large numbers of other people out of the way and depriving them of their opportunity for power once can envision scenarios that incorporate aspects of more than one of the possibilities that we have just discussed for instance it may be that machines will take over most of the work that is of real practical importance but that human beings will be kept busy by being given relatively unimportant work it has been suggested for example that a great development of the service of industries might provide work for human beings thus people will would spend their time shinning each others shoes driving each other around inn taxicab making handicrafts for one another waiting on each other s tables etc this seems to us a thoroughly contemptible way for the human race to end up and we doubt that many people would find fulfilling lives in such pointless busy work they would seek other dangerous outlets drugs crime cults hate groups unless they were biological or psychologically engineered to adapt them to such a way of life needless to say the scenarios outlined above do not exhaust all the possibilities they only indicate the kinds of outcomes that seem to us mots likely but wee can envision no plausible scenarios that are any more palatable that the ones we ve just described it is overwhelmingly probable that if the industrial technological system survives the next to years it will by that time have developed certain general characteristics individuals at least those of the bourgeois type who are integrated into the system and make it run and who therefore have all the power will be more dependent than ever on large organizations they will be more socialized that ever and their physical and mental qualities to a significant extent possibly to a very great extent will be those that are engineered into them rather than being the results of chance or of god s will or whatever and whatever may be left of wild nature will be reduced to remnants preserved for scientific study and kept under the supervision and management of scientists hence it will no longer be truly wild in the long run say a few centuries from now it is it is likely that neither the human race nor any other important organisms will exist as we know them today because once you start modifying organisms through genetic engineering there is no reason to stop at any particular point so that the modifications will probably continue until man and other organisms have been utterly transformed whatever else may be the case it is certain that technology is creating for human begins a new physical and social environment radically different from the spectrum of environments to which natural selection has adapted the human race physically and psychological if man is not adjust to this new environment by being artificially re engineered then he will be adapted to it through a long an painful process of natural selection the former is far more likely that the latter it would be better to dump the whole stinking system and take the consequences strategy the technophiles are taking us all on an utterly reckless ride into the unknown many people understand something of what technological progress is doing to us yet take a passive attitude toward it because they think it is inevitable but we fc don t think it is inevitable we think it can be stopped and we will give here some indications of how to go about stopping it as we stated in paragraph the two main tasks for the present are to promote social stress and instability in industrial society and to develop and propagate an ideology that opposes technology and the industrial system when the system becomes sufficiently stressed and unstable a revolution against technology may be possible the pattern would be similar to that of the french and russian revolutions french society and russian society for several decades prior to their respective revolutions showed increasing signs of stress and weakness meanwhile ideologies were being developed that offered a new world view that was quite different from the old one in the russian case revolutionaries were actively working to undermine the old order then when the old system was put under sufficient additional stress by financial crisis in france by military defeat in russia it was swept away by revolution what we propose in something along the same lines it will be objected that the french and russian revolutions were failures but most revolutions have two goals one is to destroy an old form of society and the other is to set up the new form of society envisioned by the revolutionaries the french and russian revolutionaries failed fortunately to create the new kind of society of which they dreamed but they were quite successful in destroying the existing form of society but an ideology in order to gain enthusiastic support must have a positive ideals well as a negative one it must be for something as well as against something the positive ideal that we propose is nature that is wild nature those aspects of the functioning of the earth and its living things that are independent of human management and free of human interference and control and with wild nature we include human nature by which we mean those aspects of the functioning of the human individual that are not subject to regulation by organized society but are products of chance or free will or god depending on your religious or philosophical opinions nature makes a perfect counter ideal to technology for several reasons nature that which is outside the power of the system is the opposite of technology which seeks to expand indefinitely the power of the system most people will agree that nature is beautiful certainly it has tremendous popular appeal the radical environmentalists already hold an ideology that exalts nature and opposes technology it is not necessary for the sake of nature to set up some chimerical utopia or any new kind of social order nature takes care of itself it was a spontaneous creation that existed long before any human society and for countless centuries many different kinds of human societies coexisted with nature without doing it an excessive amount of damage only with the industrial revolution did the effect of human society on nature become really devastating to relieve the pressure on nature it is not necessary to create a special kind of social system it is only necessary to get rid of industrial society granted this will not solve all problems industrial society has already done tremendous damage to nature and it will take a very long time for the scars to heal besides even pre industrial societies can do significant damage to nature nevertheless getting rid of industrial society will accomplish a great deal it will relieve the worst of the pressure on nature so that the scars can begin to heal it will remove the capacity of organized society to keep increasing its control over nature including human nature whatever kind of society may exist after the demise of the industrial system it is certain that most people will live close to nature because in the absence of advanced technology there is not other way that people can live to feed themselves they must be peasants or herdsmen or fishermen or hunter etc and generally speaking local autonomy should tend to increase because lack of advanced technology and rapid communications will limit the capacity of governments or other large organizations to control local communities as for the negative consequences of eliminating industrial society well you can t eat your cake and have it too to gain one thing you have to sacrifice another most people hate psychological conflict for this reason they avoid doing any serious thinking about difficult social issues and they like to have such issues presented to them in simple black and white terms this is all good and that is all bad the revolutionary ideology should therefore be developed on two levels on the more sophisticated level the ideology should address itself to people who are intelligent thoughtful and rational the object should be to create a core of people who will be opposed to the industrial system on a rational thought out basis with full appreciation of the problems and ambiguities involved and of the price that has to be paid for getting rid of the system it is particularly important to attract people of this type as they are capable people and will be instrumental in influencing others these people should be addressed on as rational a level as possible facts should never intentionally be distorted and intemperate language should be avoided this does not mean that no appeal can be made to the emotions but in making such appeal care should be taken to avoid misrepresenting the truth or doing anything else that would destroy the intellectual respectability of the ideology on a second level the ideology should be propagated in a simplified form that will enable the unthinking majority to see the conflict of technology vs nature in unambiguous terms but even on this second level the ideology should not be expressed in language that is so cheap intemperate or irrational that it alienates people of the thoughtful and rational type cheap intemperate propaganda sometimes achieves impressive short term gains but it will be more advantageous in the long run to keep the loyalty of a small number of intelligently committed people than to arouse the passions of an unthinking fickle mob who will change their attitude as soon as someone comes along with a better propaganda gimmick however propaganda of the rabble rousing type may be necessary when the system is nearing the point of collapse and there is a final struggle between rival ideologies to determine which will become dominant when the old world view goes under prior to that final struggle the revolutionaries should not expect to have a majority of people on their side history is made by active determined minorities not by the majority which seldom has a clear and consistent idea of what it really wants until the time comes for the final push toward revolution the task of revolutionaries will be less to win the shallow support of the majority than to build a small core of deeply committed people as for the majority it will be enough to make them aware of the existence of the new ideology and remind them of it frequently though of course it will be desirable to get majority support to the extent that this can be done without weakening the core of seriously committed people any kind of social conflict helps to destabilize the system but one should be careful about what kind of conflict one encourages the line of conflict should be drawn between the mass of the people and the power holding elite of industrial society politicians scientists upper level business executives government officials etc it should not be drawn between the revolutionaries and the mass of the people for example it would be bad strategy for the revolutionaries to condemn americans for their habits of consumption instead the average american should be portrayed as a victim of the advertising and marketing industry which has suckered him into buying a lot of junk that he doesn t need and that is very poor compensation for his lost freedom either approach is consistent with the facts it is merely a matter of attitude whether you blame the advertising industry for manipulating the public or blame the public for allowing itself to be manipulated as a matter of strategy one should generally avoid blaming the public one should think twice before encouraging any other social conflict than that between the power holding elite which wields technology and the general public over which technology exerts its power for one thing other conflicts tend to distract attention from the important conflicts between power elite and ordinary people between technology and nature for another thing other conflicts may actually tend to encourage technologization because each side in such a conflict wants to use technological power to gain advantages over its adversary this is clearly seen in rivalries between nations it also appears in ethnic conflicts within nations for example in america many black leaders are anxious to gain power for african americans by placing back individuals in the technological power elite they want there to be many black government officials scientists corporation executives and so forth in this way they are helping to absorb the african american subculture into the technological system generally speaking one should encourage only those social conflicts that can be fitted into the framework of the conflicts of power elite vs ordinary people technology vs nature but the way to discourage ethnic conflict is not through militant advocacy of minority rights see paragraphs instead the revolutionaries should emphasize that although minorities do suffer more or less disadvantage this disadvantage is of peripheral significance our real enemy is the industrial technological system and in the struggle against the system ethnic distinctions are of no importance the kind of revolution we have in mind will not necessarily involve an armed uprising against any government it may or may not involve physical violence but it will not be a political revolution its focus will be on technology and economics not politics probably the revolutionaries should even avoid assuming political power whether by legal or illegal means until the industrial system is stressed to the danger point and has proved itself to be a failure in the eyes of most people suppose for example that some green party should win control of the united states congress in an election in order to avoid betraying or watering down their own ideology they would have to take vigorous measures to turn economic growth into economic shrinkage to the average man the results would appear disastrous there would be massive unemployment shortages of commodities etc even if the grosser ill effects could be avoided through superhumanly skillful management still people would have to begin giving up the luxuries to which they have become addicted dissatisfaction would grow the green party would be voted out of of fice and the revolutionaries would have suffered a severe setback for this reason the revolutionaries should not try to acquire political power until the system has gotten itself into such a mess that any hardships will be seen as resulting from the failures of the industrial system itself and not from the policies of the revolutionaries the revolution against technology will probably have to be a revolution by outsiders a revolution from below and not from above the revolution must be international and worldwide it cannot be carried out on a nation by nation basis whenever it is suggested that the united states for example should cut back on technological progress or economic growth people get hysterical and start screaming that if we fall behind in technology the japanese will get ahead of us holy robots the world will fly off its orbit if the japanese ever sell more cars than we do nationalism is a great promoter of technology more reasonably it is argued that if the relatively democratic nations of the world fall behind in technology while nasty dictatorial nations like china vietnam and north korea continue to progress eventually the dictators may come to dominate the world that is why the industrial system should be attacked in all nations simultaneously to the extent that this may be possible true there is no assurance that the industrial system can be destroyed at approximately the same time all over the world and it is even conceivable that the attempt to overthrow the system could lead instead to the domination of the system by dictators that is a risk that has to be taken and it is worth taking since the difference between a democratic industrial system and one controlled by dictators is small compared with the difference between an industrial system and a non industrial one it might even be argued that an industrial system controlled by dictators would be preferable because dictator controlled systems usually have proved inefficient hence they are presumably more likely to break down look at cuba revolutionaries might consider favoring measures that tend to bind the world economy into a unified whole free trade agreements like nafta and gatt are probably harmful to the environment in the short run but in the long run they may perhaps be advantageous because they foster economic interdependence between nations i will be eaier to destroy the industrial system on a worldwide basis if he world economy is so unified that its breakdown in any on major nation will lead to its breakdwon in all industrialized nations in the long run they may perhaps be advantageous because they foster economic interdependence between nations it will be easier to destroy the industrial system on a worldwide basis if the world economy is so unified that its breakdown in any one major nation will lead to its breakdown in all industrialized nations some people take the line that modern man has too much power too much control over nature they argue for a more passive attitude on the part of the human race at best these people are expressing themselves unclearly because they fail to distinguish between power for large organizations and power for individuals and small groups it is a mistake to argue for powerlessness and passivity because people need power modern man as a collective entity that is the industrial system has immense power over nature and we fc regard this as evil but modern individuals and small groups of individuals have far less power than primitive man ever did generally speaking the vast power of modern man over nature is exercised not by individuals or small groups but by large organizations to the extent that the average modern individual can wield the power of technology he is permitted to do so only within narrow limits and only under the supervision and control of the system you need a license for everything and with the license come rules and regulations the individual has only those technological powers with which the system chooses to provide him his personal power over nature is slight primitive individuals and small groups actually had considerable power over nature or maybe it would be better to say power within nature when primitive man needed food he knew how to find and prepare edible roots how to track game and take it with homemade weapons he knew how to protect himself from heat cold rain dangerous animals etc but primitive man did relatively little damage to nature because the collective power of primitive society was negligible compared to the collective power of industrial society instead of arguing for powerlessness and passivity one should argue that the power of the industrial system should be broken and that this will greatly increase the power and freedom of individuals and small groups until the industrial system has been thoroughly wrecked the destruction of that system must be the revolutionaries only goal other goals would distract attention and energy from the main goal more importantly if the revolutionaries permit themselves to have any other goal than the destruction of technology they will be tempted to use technology as a tool for reaching that other goal if they give in to that temptation they will fall right back into the technological trap because modern technology is a unified tightly organized system so that in order to retain some technology one finds oneself obliged to retain most technology hence one ends up sacrificing only token amounts of technology suppose for example that the revolutionaries took social justice as a goal human nature being what it is social justice would not come about spontaneously it would have to be enforced in order to enforce it the revolutionaries would have to retain central organization and control for that they would need rapid long distance transportation and communication and therefore all the technology needed to support the transportation and communication systems to feed and clothe poor people they would have to use agricultural and manufacturing technology and so forth so that the attempt to insure social justice would force them to retain most parts of the technological system not that we have anything against social justice but it must not be allowed to interfere with the effort to get rid of the technological system it would be hopeless for revolutionaries to try to attack the system without using some modern technology if nothing else they must use the communications media to spread their message but they should use modern technology for only one purpose to attack the technological system imagine an alcoholic sitting with a barrel of wine in front of him suppose he starts saying to himself wine isn t bad for you if used in moderation why they say small amounts of wine are even good for you it won t do me any harm if i take just one little drink well you know what is going to happen never forget that the human race with technology is just like an alcoholic with a barrel of wine revolutionaries should have as many children as they can there is strong scientific evidence that social attitudes are to a significant extent inherited no one suggests that a social attitude is a direct outcome of a person s genetic constitution but it appears that personality traits tend within the context of our society to make a person more likely to hold this or that social attitude objections to these findings have been raised but objections are feeble and seem to be ideologically motivated in any event no one denies that children tend on the average to hold social attitudes similar to those of their parents from our point of view it doesn t matter all that much whether the attitudes are passed on genetically or through childhood training in either case the are passed on the trouble is that many of the people who are inclined to rebel against the industrial system are also concerned about the population problems hence they are apt to have few or no children in this way they may be handing the world over to the sort of people who support or at least accept the industrial system to insure the strength of the next generation of revolutionaries the present generation must reproduce itself abundantly in doing so they will be worsening the population problem only slightly and the most important problem is to get rid of the industrial system because once the industrial system is gone the world s population necessarily will decrease see paragraph whereas if the industrial system survives it will continue developing new techniques of food production that may enable the world s population to keep increasing almost indefinitely with regard to revolutionary strategy the only points on which we absolutely insist are that the single overriding goal must be the elimination of modern technology and that no other goal can be allowed to compete with this one for the rest revolutionaries should take an empirical approach if experience indicates that some of the recommendations made in the foregoing paragraphs are not going to give good results then those recommendations should be discarded two kinds of technology an argument likely to be raised against our proposed revolution is that it is bound to fail because it is claimed throughout history technology has always progressed never regressed hence technological regression is impossible but this claim is false we distinguish between two kinds of technology which we will call small scale technology and organization dependent technology small scale technology is technology that can be used by small scale communities without outside assistance organization dependent technology is technology that depends on large scale social organization we are aware of no significant cases of regression in small scale technology but organization dependent technology does regress when the social organization on which it depends breaks down example when the roman empire fell apart the romans small scale technology survived because any clever village craftsman could build for instance a water wheel any skilled smith could make steel by roman methods and so forth but the romans organization dependent technology did regress their aqueducts fell into disrepair and were never rebuilt their techniques of road construction were lost the roman system of urban sanitation was forgotten so that until rather recent times did the sanitation of european cities that of ancient rome the reason why technology has seemed always to progress is that until perhaps a century or two before the industrial revolution most technology was small scale technology but most of the technology developed since the industrial revolution is organization dependent technology take the refrigerator for example without factory made parts or the facilities of a post industrial machine shop it would be virtually impossible for a handful of local craftsmen to build a refrigerator if by some miracle they did succeed in building one it would be useless to them without a reliable source of electric power so they would have to dam a stream and build a generator generators require large amounts of copper wire imagine trying to make that wire without modern machinery and where would they get a gas suitable for refrigeration it would be much easier to build an icehouse or preserve food by drying or picking as was done before the invention of the refrigerator so it is clear that if the industrial system were once thoroughly broken down refrigeration technology would quickly be lost the same is true of other organization dependent technology and once this technology had been lost for a generation or so it would take centuries to rebuild it just as it took centuries to build it the first time around surviving technical books would be few and scattered an industrial society if built from scratch without outside help can only be built in a series of stages you need tools to make tools to make tools to make tools a long process of economic development and progress in social organization is required and even in the absence of an ideology opposed to technology there is no reason to believe that anyone would be interested in rebuilding industrial society the enthusiasm for progress is a phenomenon particular to the modern form of society and it seems not to have existed prior to the th century or thereabouts in the late middle ages there were four main civilizations that were about equally advanced europe the islamic world india and the far east china japan korea three of those civilizations remained more or less stable and only europe became dynamic no one knows why europe became dynamic at that time historians have their theories but these are only speculation at any rate it is clear that rapid development toward a technological form of society occurs only under special conditions so there is no reason to assume that long lasting technological regression cannot be brought about would society eventually develop again toward an industrial technological form maybe but there is no use in worrying about it since we can t predict or control events or years in the future those problems must be dealt with by the people who will live at that time the danger of leftism because of their need for rebellion and for membership in a movement leftists or persons of similar psychological type are often unattracted to a rebellious or activist movement whose goals and membership are not initially leftist the resulting influx of leftish types can easily turn a non leftist movement into a leftist one so that leftist goals replace or distort the original goals of the movement to avoid this a movement that exalts nature and opposes technology must take a resolutely anti leftist stance and must avoid all collaboration with leftists leftism is in the long run inconsistent with wild nature with human freedom and with the elimination of modern technology leftism is collectivist it seeks to bind together the entire world both nature and the human race into a unified whole but this implies management of nature and of human life by organized society and it requires advanced technology you can t have a united world without rapid transportation and communication you can t make all people love one another without sophisticated psychological techniques you can t have a planned society without the necessary technological base above all leftism is driven by the need for power and the leftist seeks power on a collective basis through identification with a mass movement or an organization leftism is unlikely ever to give up technology because technology is too valuable a source of collective power the anarchist too seeks power but he seeks it on an individual or small group basis he wants individuals and small groups to be able to control the circumstances of their own lives he opposes technology because it makes small groups dependent on large organizations some leftists may seem to oppose technology but they will oppose it only so long as they are outsiders and the technological system is controlled by non leftists if leftism ever becomes dominant in society so that the technological system becomes a tool in the hands of leftists they will enthusiastically use it and promote its growth in doing this they will be repeating a pattern that leftism has shown again and again in the past when the bolsheviks in russia were outsiders they vigorously opposed censorship and the secret police they advocated self determination for ethnic minorities and so forth but as soon as they came into power themselves they imposed a tighter censorship and created a more ruthless secret police than any that had existed under the tsars and they oppressed ethnic minorities at least as much as the tsars had done in the united states a couple of decades ago when leftists were a minority in our universities leftist professors were vigorous proponents of academic freedom but today in those universities where leftists have become dominant they have shown themselves ready to take away from everyone else s academic freedom this is political correctness the same will happen with leftists and technology they will use it to oppress everyone else if they ever get it under their own control in earlier revolutions leftists of the most power hungry type repeatedly have first cooperated with non leftist revolutionaries as well as with leftists of a more libertarian inclination and later have double crossed them to seize power for themselves robespierre did this in the french revolution the bolsheviks did it in the russian revolution the communists did it in spain in and castro and his followers did it in cuba given the past history of leftism it would be utterly foolish for non leftist revolutionaries today to collaborate with leftists various thinkers have pointed out that leftism is a kind of religion leftism is not a religion in the strict sense because leftist doctrine does not postulate the existence of any supernatural being but for the leftist leftism plays a psychological role much like that which religion plays for some people the leftist needs to believe in leftism it plays a vital role in his psychological economy his beliefs are not easily modified by logic or facts he has a deep conviction that leftism is morally right with a capital r and that he has not only a right but a duty to impose leftist morality on everyone however many of the people we are referring to as leftists do not think of themselves as leftists and would not describe their system of beliefs as leftism we use the term leftism because we don t know of any better words to designate the spectrum of related creeds that includes the feminist gay rights political correctness etc movements and because these movements have a strong affinity with the old left see paragraphs leftism is totalitarian force wherever leftism is in a position of power it tends to invade every private corner and force every thought into a leftist mold in part this is because of the quasi religious character of leftism everything contrary to leftists beliefs represents sin more importantly leftism is a totalitarian force because of the leftists drive for power the leftist seeks to satisfy his need for power through identification with a social movement and he tries to go through the power process by helping to pursue and attain the goals of the movement see paragraph but no matter how far the movement has gone in attaining its goals the leftist is never satisfied because his activism is a surrogate activity see paragraph that is the leftist s real motive is not to attain the ostensible goals of leftism in reality he is motivated by the sense of power he gets from struggling for and then reaching a social goal consequently the leftist is never satisfied with the goals he has already attained his need for the power process leads him always to pursue some new goal the leftist wants equal opportunities for minorities when that is attained he insists on statistical equality of achievement by minorities and as long as anyone harbors in some corner of his mind a negative attitude toward some minority the leftist has to re educated him and ethnic minorities are not enough no one can be allowed to have a negative attitude toward homosexuals disabled people fat people old people ugly people and on and on and on it s not enough that the public should be informed about the hazards of smoking a warning has to be stamped on every package of cigarettes then cigarette advertising has to be restricted if not banned the activists will never be satisfied until tobacco is outlawed and after that it will be alco hot then junk food etc activists have fought gross child abuse which is reasonable but now they want to stop all spanking when they have done that they will want to ban something else they consider unwholesome then another thing and then another they will never be satisfied until they have complete control over all child rearing practices and then they will move on to another cause suppose you asked leftists to make a list of all the things that were wrong with society and then suppose you instituted every social change that they demanded it is safe to say that within a couple of years the majority of leftists would find something new to complain about some new social evil to correct because once again the leftist is motivated less by distress at society s ills than by the need to satisfy his drive for power by imposing his solutions on society because of the restrictions placed on their thoughts and behavior by their high level of socialization many leftists of the over socialized type cannot pursue power in the ways that other people do for them the drive for power has only one morally acceptable outlet and that is in the struggle to impose their morality on everyone leftists especially those of the oversocialized type are true believers in the sense of eric hoffer s book the true believer but not all true believers are of the same psychological type as leftists presumably a truebelieving nazi for instance is very different psychologically from a truebelieving leftist because of their capacity for single minded devotion to a cause true believers are a useful perhaps a necessary ingredient of any revolutionary movement this presents a problem with which we must admit we don t know how to deal we aren t sure how to harness the energies of the true believer to a revolution against technology at present all we can say is that no true believer will make a safe recruit to the revolution unless his commitment is exclusively to the destruction of technology if he is committed also to another ideal he may want to use technology as a tool for pursuing that other ideal see paragraphs some readers may say this stuff about leftism is a lot of crap i know john and jane who are leftish types and they don t have all these totalitarian tendencies it s quite true that many leftists possibly even a numerical majority are decent people who sincerely believe in tolerating others values up to a point and wouldn t want to use high handed methods to reach their social goals our remarks about leftism are not meant to apply to every individual leftist but to describe the general character of leftism as a movement and the general character of a movement is not necessarily determined by the numerical proportions of the various kinds of people involved in the movement the people who rise to positions of power in leftist movements tend to be leftists of the most power hungry type because power hungry people are those who strive hardest to get into positions of power once the power hungry types have captured control of the movement there are many leftists of a gentler breed who inwardly disapprove of many of the actions of the leaders but cannot bring themselves to oppose them they need their faith in the movement and because they cannot give up this faith they go along with the leaders true some leftists do have the guts to oppose the totalitarian tendencies that emerge but they generally lose because the power hungry types are better organized are more ruthless and machiavellian and have taken care to build themselves a strong power base these phenomena appeared clearly in russia and other countries that were taken over by leftists similarly before the breakdown of communism in the ussr leftish types in the west would seldom criticize that country if prodded they would admit that the ussr did many wrong things but then they would try to find excuses for the communists and begin talking about the faults of the west they always opposed western military resistance to communist aggression leftish types all over the world vigorously protested the u s military action in vietnam but when the ussr invaded afghanistan they did nothing not that they approved of the soviet actions but because of their leftist faith they just couldn t bear to put themselves in opposition to communism today in those of our universities where political correctness has become dominant there are probably many leftish types who privately disapprove of the suppression of academic freedom but they go along with it anyway thus the fact that many individual leftists are personally mild and fairly tolerant people by no means prevents leftism as a whole form having a totalitarian tendency our discussion of leftism has a serious weakness it is still far from clear what we mean by the word leftist there doesn t seem to be much we can do about this today leftism is fragmented into a whole spectrum of activist movements yet not all activist movements are leftist and some activist movements e g radical environmentalism seem to include both personalities of the leftist type and personalities of thoroughly un leftist types who ought to know better than to collaborate with leftists varieties of leftists fade out gradually into varieties of non leftists and we ourselves would often be hard pressed to decide whether a given individual is or is not a leftist to the extent that it is defined at all our conception of leftism is defined by the discussion of it that we have given in this article and we can only advise the reader to use his own judgment in deciding who is a leftist but it will be helpful to list some criteria for diagnosing leftism these criteria cannot be applied in a cut and dried manner some individuals may meet some of the criteria without being leftists some leftists may not meet any of the criteria again you just have to use your judgment the leftist is oriented toward largescale collectivism he emphasizes the duty of the individual to serve society and the duty of society to take care of the individual he has a negative attitude toward individualism he often takes a moralistic tone he tends to be for gun control for sex education and other psychologically enlightened educational methods for planning for affirmative action for multiculturalism he tends to identify with victims he tends to be against competition and against violence but he often finds excuses for those leftists who do commit violence he is fond of using the common catch phrases of the left like racism sexism homophobia capitalism imperialism neocolonialism genocide social change social justice social responsibility maybe the best diagnostic trait of the leftist is his tendency to sympathize with the following movements feminism gay rights ethnic rights disability rights animal rights political correctness anyone who strongly sympathizes with all of these movements is almost certainly a leftist the more dangerous leftists that is those who are most power hungry are often characterized by arrogance or by a dogmatic approach to ideology however the most dangerous leftists of all may be certain oversocialized types who avoid irritating displays of aggressiveness and refrain from advertising their leftism but work quietly and unobtrusively to promote collectivist values enlightened psychological techniques for socializing children dependence of the individual on the system and so forth these crypto leftists as we may call them approximate certain bourgeois types as far as practical action is concerned but differ from them in psychology ideology and motivation the ordinary bourgeois tries to bring people under control of the system in order to protect his way of life or he does so simply because his attitudes are conventional the crypto leftist tries to bring people under control of the system because he is a true believer in a collectivistic ideology the crypto leftist is differentiated from the average leftist of the oversocialized type by the fact that his rebellious impulse is weaker and he is more securely socialized he is differentiated from the ordinary well socialized bourgeois by the fact that there is some deep lack within him that makes it necessary for him to devote himself to a cause and immerse himself in a collectivity and maybe his well sublimated drive for power is stronger than that of the average bourgeois final note throughout this article we ve made imprecise statements and statements that ought to have had all sorts of qualifications and reservations attached to them and some of our statements may be flatly false lack of sufficient information and the need for brevity made it impossible for us to fomulate our assertions more precisely or add all the necessary qualifications and of course in a discussion of this kind one must rely heavily on intuitive judgment and that can sometimes be wrong so we don t claim that this article expresses more than a crude approximation to the truth all the same we are reasonably confident that the general outlines of the picture we have painted here are roughly correct we have portrayed leftism in its modern form as a phenomenon peculiar to our time and as a symptom of the disruption of the power process but we might possibly be wrong about this oversocialized types who try to satisfy their drive for power by imposing their morality on everyone have certainly been around for a long time but we think that the decisive role played by feelings of inferiority low self esteem powerlessness identification with victims by people who are not themselves victims is a peculiarity of modern leftism identification with victims by people not themselves victims can be seen to some extent in th century leftism and early christianity but as far as we can make out symptoms of low self esteem etc were not nearly so evident in these movements or in any other movements as they are in modern leftism but we are not in a position to assert confidently that no such movements have existed prior to modern leftism this is a significant question to which historians ought to give their attention introduction the industrial revolution and its consequences have been a disaster for the human race they have greatly increased the life expectancy of those of us who live in advanced countries but they have destabilized society have made life unfulfilling have subjected human beings to indignities have led to widespread psychological suffering in the third world to physical suffering as well and have inflicted severe damage on the natural world the continued development of technology will worsen the situation it will certainly subject human beings to greater indignities and inflict greater damage on the natural world it will probably lead to greater social disruption and psychological suffering and it may lead to increased physical suffering even in advanced countries the industrial technological system may survive or it may break down if it survives it may eventually achieve a low level of physical and psychological suffering but only after passing through a long and very painful period of adjustment and only at the cost of permanently reducing human beings and many other living organisms to engineered products and mere cogs in the social machine furthermore if the system survives the consequences will be inevitable there is no way of reforming or modifying the system so as to prevent it from depriving people of dignity and autonomy if the system breaks down the consequences will still be very painful but the bigger the system grows the more disastrous the results of its breakdown will be so if it is to break down it had best break down sooner rather than later we therefore advocate a revolution against the industrial system this revolution may or may not make use of violence it may be sudden or it may be a relatively gradual process spanning a few decades we can t predict any of that but we do outline in a very general way the measures that those who hate the industrial system should take in order to prepare the way for a revolution against that form of society this is not to be a political revolution its object will be to overthrow not governments but the economic and technological basis of the present society in this article we give attention to only some of the negative developments that have grown out of the industrial technological system other such developments we mention only briefly or ignore altogether this does not mean that we regard these other developments as unimportant for practical reasons we have to confine our discussion to areas that have received insufficient public attention or in which we have something new to say for example since there are well developed environmental and wilderness movements we have written very little about environmental degradation or the destruction of wild nature even though we consider these to be highly important the psychology of modern leftism almost everyone will agree that we live in a deeply troubled society one of the most widespread manifestations of the craziness of our world is leftism so a discussion of the psychology of leftism can serve as an introduction to the discussion of the problems of modern society in general but what is leftism during the first half of the th century leftism could have been practically identified with socialism today the movement is fragmented and it is not clear who can properly be called a leftist when we speak of leftists in this article we have in mind mainly socialists collectivists politically correct types feminists gay and disability activists animal rights activists and the like but not everyone who is associated with one of these movements is a leftist what we are trying to get at in discussing leftism is not so much a movement or an ideology as a psychological type or rather a collection of related types thus what we mean by leftism will emerge more clearly in the course of our discussion of leftist psychology also see paragraphs even so our conception of leftism will remain a good deal less clear than we would wish but there doesn t seem to be any remedy for this all we are trying to do is indicate in a rough and approximate way the two psychological tendencies that we believe are the main driving force of modern leftism we by no means claim to be telling the whole truth about leftist psychology also our discussion is meant to apply to modern leftism only we leave open the question of the extent to which our discussion could be applied to the leftists of the th and early th century the two psychological tendencies that underlie modern leftism we call feelings of inferiority and oversocialization feelings of inferiority are characteristic of modern leftism as a whole while oversocialization is characteristic only of a certain segment of modern leftism but this segment is highly influential feelings of inferiority by feelings of inferiority we mean not only inferiority feelings in the strictest sense but a whole spectrum of related traits low self esteem feelings of powerlessness depressive tendencies defeatism guilt self hatred etc we argue that modern leftists tend to have such feelings possibly more or less repressed and that these feelings are decisive in determining the direction of modern leftism when someone interprets as derogatory almost anything that is said about him or about groups with whom he identifies we conclude that he has inferiority feelings or low self esteem this tendency is pronounced among minority rights advocates whether or not they belong to the minority groups whose rights they defend they are hypersensitive about the words used to designate minorities the terms negro oriental handicapped or chick for an african an asian a disabled person or a woman originally had no derogatory connotation broad and chick were merely the feminine equivalents of guy dude or fellow the negative connotations have been attached to these terms by the activists themselves some animal rights advocates have gone so far as to reject the word pet and insist on its replacement by animal companion leftist anthropologists go to great lengths to avoid saying anything about primitive peoples that could conceivably be interpreted as negative they want to replace the word primitive by nonliterate they seem almost paranoid about anything that might suggest that any primitive culture is inferior to our own we do not mean to imply that primitive cultures are inferior to ours we merely point out the hypersensitivity of leftish anthropologists those who are most sensitive about politically incorrect terminology are not the average black ghetto dweller asian immigrant abused woman or disabled person but a minority of activists many of whom do not even belong to any oppressed group but come from privileged strata of society political correctness has its stronghold among university professors who have secure employment with comfortable salaries and the majority of whom are heterosexual white males from middle class families many leftists have an intense identification with the problems of groups that have an image of being weak women defeated american indians repellent homosexuals or otherwise inferior the leftists themselves feel that these groups are inferior they would never admit it to themselves that they have such feelings but it is precisely because they do see these groups as inferior that they identify with their problems we do not suggest that women indians etc are inferior we are only making a point about leftist psychology feminists are desperately anxious to prove that women are as strong as capable as men clearly they are nagged by a fear that women may not be as strong and as capable as men leftists tend to hate anything that has an image of being strong good and successful they hate america they hate western civilization they hate white males they hate rationality the reasons that leftists give for hating the west etc clearly do not correspond with their real motives they say they hate the west because it is warlike imperialistic sexist ethnocentric and so forth but where these same faults appear in socialist countries or in primitive cultures the leftist finds excuses for them or at best he grudgingly admits that they exist whereas he enthusiastically points out and often greatly exaggerates these faults where they appear in western civilization thus it is clear that these faults are not the leftist s real motive for hating america and the west he hates america and the west because they are strong and successful words like self confidence self reliance initiative enterprise optimism etc play little role in the liberal and leftist vocabulary the leftist is anti individualistic pro collectivist he wants society to solve everyone s needs for them take care of them he is not the sort of person who has an inner sense of confidence in his own ability to solve his own problems and satisfy his own needs the leftist is antagonistic to the concept of competition because deep inside he feels like a loser art forms that appeal to modern leftist intellectuals tend to focus on sordidness defeat and despair or else they take an orgiastic tone throwing off rational control as if there were no hope of accomplishing anything through rational calculation and all that was left was to immerse oneself in the sensations of the moment modern leftist philosophers tend to dismiss reason science objective reality and to insist that everything is culturally relative it is true that one can ask serious questions about the foundations of scientific knowledge and about how if at all the concept of objective reality can be defined but it is obvious that modern leftist philosophers are not simply cool headed logicians systematically analyzing the foundations of knowledge they are deeply involved emotionally in their attack on truth and reality they attack these concepts because of their own psychological needs for one thing their attack is an outlet for hostility and to the extent that it is successful it satisfies the drive for power more importantly the leftist hates science and rationality because they classify certain beliefs as true i e successful superior and other beliefs as false i e failed inferior the leftist s feelings of inferiority run so deep that he cannot tolerate any classification of some things as successful or superior and other things as failed or inferior this also underlies the rejection by many leftists of the concept of mental illness and of the utility of iq tests leftists are antagonistic to genetic explanations of human abilities or behavior because such explanations tend to make some persons appear superior or inferior to others leftists prefer to give society the credit or blame for an individual s ability or lack of it thus if a person is inferior it is not his fault but society s because he has not been brought up properly the leftist is not typically the kind of person whose feelings of inferiority make him a braggart an egotist a bully a self promoter a ruthless competitor this kind of person has not wholly lost faith in himself he has a deficit in his sense of power and self worth but he can still conceive of himself as having the capacity to be strong and his efforts to make himself strong produce his unpleasant behavior but \n"
